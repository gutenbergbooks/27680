<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>A LESSON IN RESPECT FOR THE UNIFORM</h3>


<div class='cap'>"AW, what's the difference between a
soldier and a loafer?" demanded
"Bunny" Hepburn.</div>

<p>"A soldier ain't a loafer, and it takes nerve
to be a soldier. It's a job for the bravest kind
of a man," retorted Jud Jeffers indignantly.</p>

<p>"Answer my c'nundrum," insisted Bunny.</p>

<p>"It ain't a decent conundrum," retorted Jud,
with dignity, for his father had served as a volunteer
soldier in the war with Spain.</p>

<p>"Go on, Bunny," broke in another boy in the
group, laughing. "I'll be the goat. What is
the difference between a soldier and a loafer?"</p>

<p>"A soldier gets paid and fed, and the other
loafer doesn't," retorted Bunny, with a broadening
grin. A moment later, when he realized
that his "joke" had failed to raise a laugh,
Bunny looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"Aw, go on," flared up Jud Jeffers. "You
don't know anything about a soldier."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"But my dad does," retorted Bunny positively.
"Dad says soldiers don't produce anything
for a living; that they take their pay out
of the pockets of the public, and then laugh at
the public for fools."</p>

<p>"And what does your father do for a living?"
demanded Jud hotly.</p>

<p>"He's a man who knows a lot, and he lectures,"
declared Bunny, swelling with importance.
"When my dad talks a whole lot of men
get excited and cheer him."</p>

<p>"Yes, and they buy him beer, too," jeered
Jud, hot with derision for the fellow who was
running down the soldiers of the United States.
"Your father does his lecturing in small, dirty
halls, where there's always a beer saloon underneath.
You talk about men being producers&mdash;and
your father goes around making anarchistic
speeches to a lot of workingmen who are down
on everything because they aren't clever enough
to earn as good wages as sober, industrious and
capable workmen earn."</p>

<p>"Speech, Jud!" laughingly roared another
boy in the crowd that now numbered a score of
youngsters.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare talk against my dad!" sputtered
Bunny, doubling his fists and trying to
look fierce.</p>

<p>"Then don't say anything against soldiers,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
retorted Jud indignantly. "My father was one.
I tell you, soldiers are the salt of the earth."</p>

<p>"Say, but they're a fine and dandy-looking
lot, anyway," spoke up Tom Andrews, as he
turned toward the post-office window in front of
which the principal actors in this scene were
standing. The place was one of the smaller
cities in New Jersey.</p>

<p>In the post-office window hung a many-colored
poster, headed "Recruits Wanted for the
United States Army." Soldiers of the various
arms of the service were shown, and in all the
types of uniforms worn on the different occasions.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they're a fine and dandy lot of
loafers&mdash;them soldiers!" declared Bunny Hepburn
contemptuously.</p>

<p>This opinion might not have gotten him into
trouble, but he emphasized his opinion by spitting
straight at the glass over the center of the
picture.</p>

<p>"You coward!" choked Jud.</p>

<p>Biff!</p>

<p>Jud Jeffer's fist shot out, with all the force
there is in fourteen-year-old muscle. The fist
caught Bunny Hepburn on the side of the face
and sent him sprawling.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Jud!" roared several of the
young boys together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go for him, Jud! He's mad, and wants it,"
called Tom Andrews.</p>

<p>Bunny was mad, all the way through, even
before he leaped to his feet. Yet Bunny was
not especially fond of fighting, and his anger
was tempered with caution.</p>

<p>"You dassent do that again," he taunted,
dancing about before Jud.</p>

<p>"I will, if you give me the same cause," replied
Jud.</p>

<p>Bunny deliberately repeated his offensive act.
Then he dodged, but not fast enough. Jud Jeffer's,
his eyes ablaze with righteous indignation,
sent the troublesome one to earth again.</p>

<p>This time Bunny got up really full of fight.</p>

<p>From the opposite side of the street two fine-looking
young men of about eighteen had seen
much of what had passed.</p>

<p>"Let's go over and separate them, Hal," proposed
the quieter looking of the pair.</p>

<p>"If you like, Noll, though that young Hepburn
rascal deserves about all that he seems
likely to get."</p>

<p>"Jud Jeffers is too decent a young fellow to
be allowed to soil his hands on the Hepburn
kid," objected Oliver Terry quietly.</p>

<p>So he and Hal Overton hastened across the
street.</p>

<p>Bunny Hepburn was now showing a faint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
daub of crimson at the lower end of his nose.
Bunny was the larger boy, but Jud by far the
braver.</p>

<p>"Here, better stop all of this," broke in Hal
good-naturedly, reaching out and grabbing
angry Bunny by the coat collar.</p>

<p>Noll rested a rather friendly though detaining
hand on Jud Jeffers's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Lemme at him!" roared Bunny.</p>

<p>"Yes! Let 'em finish it!" urged three or
four of the younger boys.</p>

<p>"What's it all about, anyway?" demanded
Hal Overton.</p>

<p>"That fellow insulted his country's uniform.
It's as bad as insulting the Flag itself!" contended
Jud hotly.</p>

<p>"That's right," nodded Hal Overton grimly.
"I think I saw the whole thing. You're right
to be mad about it, Jud, but this young what-is-it
is too mean for you to soil your hands on him.
Now, see here, Hepburn&mdash;right about face for
you!"</p>

<p>Hal's grip on the boy's coat collar tightened
as he swung Bunny about and headed him down
the street.</p>

<p>"Forward, quick time, march! And don't
stop, either, Hepburn, unless you want to hear
Jud pattering down the street after you."</p>

<p>Hal's first shove sent Bunny darting along for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a few feet. Bunny discreetly went down the
street several yards before he halted and lurched
into a doorway, from which he peered out with
a still hostile look on his face.</p>

<p>"Your view of the uniform, and of the old
Flag, is all right, Jud, and I'm mighty glad to
find that you have such views," Hal continued.
"But you mustn't be too severe on a fellow like
Bunny Hepburn. He simply can't rise above
his surroundings, and you know what a miserable,
egotistical, lying, slanderous fellow his
father is. Bunny's father hates the country he
lives in, and would set everybody to tearing
down the government. That's the kind of a
brainless anarchist Hepburn is, and you can't
expect his dull-witted son to know any more
than the father does. But you keep on, Jud,
always respecting the soldier and his uniform,
and the Flag that both stand behind."</p>

<p>"It gets on a good many of us," spoke up
Tom Andrews, "to hear Bunny always running
down the soldiers. He believes all his father
says, so he keeps telling us that we're a nation
of crooks and thieves, that the government is
the rottenest ever, and that our soldiers and
sailors are the biggest loafers of the whole
American lot."</p>

<p>"It's enough to disgust anybody," spoke up
Oliver Terry quietly. "But, boys, people who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
talk the way the Hepburns do are never worth
fighting with. And, unless they're stung hard,
they won't fight, anyway."</p>

<p>"Oh, won't they?" growled Bunny, who, listening
to all this talk with a flaming face, now
retreated down the street. "Wait until I tell
dad all about this nonsense about the Flag and
the uniform!"</p>

<p>Hal and Noll stood for some moments gazing
at the attractive recruiting poster in the post-office
window. One by one the boys who had
gathered went off in search of other interest or
sport, until only Jud and Tom remained near
the two older boys.</p>

<p>"I reckon you think I was foolish, don't you,
Hal?" asked Jud, at last.</p>

<p>"No; not just that," replied Overton, turning,
with a smile. "No American can ever be
foolish to insist on respect for the country's
Flag and uniform."</p>

<p>"I simply can't stand by and hear soldiers
sneered at. My father was a soldier, you know,
even if he was only a war-time volunteer, and
didn't serve a whole year."</p>

<p>"When you get out of patience with fellows
like Bunny Hepburn," suggested Noll Terry,
"just you compare your father with a fellow
like Bunny's father. You know, well enough,
that your father, as a useful and valuable citizen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
is worth more than a thousand Hepburns can
ever be."</p>

<p>"That's right," nodded Hal, with vigor.
"And there's another man in this town that you
can compare with Bunny's father. You know
Mr. Wright? Sergeant Wright is his proper
title. He's an old, retired sergeant from the
Regular Army, who served his country fighting
Indians and Spaniards, and now he has settled
down here&mdash;a fine, upright, honest American,
middle aged, and with retired pay and savings
enough to support him as long as he lives. I
haven't met many men as fine as Sergeant
Wright."</p>

<p>"I know," nodded Jud, his eyes shining.
"Sergeant Wright is a fine man. Sometimes he
talks to Tom and me an hour at a time, telling
us all about the campaigns he has served in.
Say, Hal, you and Noll ought to call on him and
ask him for some of his grand old Indian stories."</p>

<p>"We know some of them," laughed Hal.
"Noll and I have been calling there often."</p>

<p>"You have?" said Jud gleefully. "Say,
ain't Sergeant Wright one of the finest men
ever? I'll bet he's been a regular up-and-down
hero himself, though he never tells us anything
about his own big deeds."</p>

<p>"He wears the medal of Congress," replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Hal warmly. "A soldier who wears that
doesn't need to brag."</p>

<p>"Say," remarked Jud thoughtfully, "I guess
you two fellows are about as much struck with
the soldiers as I am."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you and Tom something&mdash;if you can
keep a secret," replied Hal Overton, after a
side glance at his chum.</p>

<p>"Oh, we can keep secrets all right!" protested
Tom Andrews.</p>

<p>"Well, then, fellows, Noll and I are going to
New York to-morrow, to try to enlist in the
Regular Army."</p>

<p>"You are?" gasped Jud, staring at Hal and
Noll in round-eyed delight. "Oh, say, but you
two ought to make dandy soldiers!"</p>

<p>"If the recruiting officer accepts us we'll do
the best that's in us," smiled Hal.</p>

<p>"You'll be regular heroes!" predicted Jud,
gazing at these two fortunate youngsters with
eyes wide open with approval.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, we can't be heroes," grimaced Noll.
"We're going to be regulars, and it's only the
volunteers who are allowed to be heroes, you
know," added Noll jocosely. "There's nothing
heroic about a regular fighting bravely. That's
his trade and his training."</p>

<p>"Don't you youngsters tell anyone," Hal insisted.
"Or we shall be sorry that we told you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you take us for?" demanded Jud
scornfully.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll had had it in mind to stroll off
by themselves, for this was likely to be their
last day in the home town for many a day to
come. But Jud and Tom were full of hero worship
of the two budding soldier boys, and walked
along with them.</p>

<p>"There's Tip Branders," muttered Tom suddenly.</p>

<p>"I don't care," retorted Jud. "He won't
dare try anything on us; and, if he does, we can
take care of him."</p>

<p>"What has Tip against you?" asked Hal
Overton.</p>

<p>"He tried to thrash me, yesterday."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I guess it was because I told him what I
thought of him," admitted Jud, with a grin.</p>

<p>"How did that happen?"</p>

<p>"Well, Tom and I were down in City Hall
Park, sitting on one of the benches. Tip came
along and ordered us off the bench; said he
wanted to sit there himself. I told him he was
a loafer and told him we wouldn't get off the
bench for anybody like him."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Hal.</p>

<p>"Why, Tip just made a dive for me, and there
was trouble in his eyes; so I reconsidered, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
made a quick get-away. So did Tom. Tip
chased us a little way, but we went so fast that
we made it too much work for him. So he
halted, but yelled after us that he'd tan us the
next time he got close enough."</p>

<p>Tip Branders surely deserved the epithet of
"loafer." Though only nineteen he had the
look of being past twenty-one. He was a big,
powerful fellow. Though he had not been at
school since he was fifteen, Tip had not worked
three months in the last four years. His mother,
who kept a large and prosperous boarding-house,
regarded Tip as being one of the manliest
fellows in the world. She abetted his idleness
by supplying him with too much money.
Tip dressed well, though a bit loudly, and walked
with a swagger. He was in a fair way to go
through life without becoming anything more
than a bully.</p>

<p>Hal Overton, on the other hand, was a quiet
though merry young man, just above medium
height, slim, though well built, brown-haired,
blue-eyed, and a capable, industrious young fellow.
The elder Overton was a clerk in a local
store. Ill-health through many years had kept
the father from prospering, and Hal, after two
years in High School, had gone to work in the
same store with his father at the age of sixteen.</p>

<p>Oliver Terry, too, had been at work since the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
age of sixteen. Noll's father was engineer at
one of the local machine shops, so Noll had gone
into one of the lathe rooms, and was already
accounted a very fair young mechanic.</p>

<p>Both were only sons; and, in the case of each,
the fathers and mothers had felt sorry, indeed,
to see the young men go to work before they had
at least completed their High School courses.</p>

<p>By this time the fathers of both Hal and Noll
had found themselves in somewhat better circumstances.
Hal and Noll, being ambitious,
had both felt dissatisfied, of late, with their
surroundings and prospects, and both had
received parental permission to better themselves
if they could. So our two young friends,
after many talks, and especially with Sergeant
Wright, had decided to serve at least three years
in the regular army by way of preliminary training.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, few American youths, comparatively
speaking, are aware of the splendid
training that the United States Army offers to
a young American. The Army offers splendid
grounding for the young man who prefers to
serve but a single enlistment and then return
to civil life. But it also offers a solidly good
career to the young man who enlists and remains
with the colors until he is retired after
thirty years of continuous service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Both Hal and Noll had looked thoroughly into
the question, and each was now convinced that
the Army offered him the best place in life.
Both boys had very definite ideas of what they
expected to accomplish by entering the Army,
as will appear presently.</p>

<p>Tip&mdash;even Tip Branders&mdash;had something of
an ambition in life. So far as he had done anything,
Tip had "trained" with a gang of young
hoodlums who were "useful" to the political
machine in one of the tough wards of the little
city. Tip's ultimate idea was to "get a city
job," at good pay, and do little or nothing for
the pay.</p>

<p>But Tip dreaded a civil service examination&mdash;knew,
in fact, that he could not pass one. In
most American cities, to-day, an honorably discharged
enlisted man from the Army or Navy
is allowed to take an appointment to a city position
without civil service examination, or else
to do so on a lower marking than would be accepted
from any other candidate for a city job.</p>

<p>So, curiously enough, Tip had decided to
serve in the United States Army. One term
would be enough to serve his purpose.</p>

<p>Tip, too, had kept his resolve a secret&mdash;even
from his mother.</p>

<p>As Hal and Noll, Jud and Tom strolled along
they came up with Tip Branders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"So this is you, you little freshy!" growled
Tip, halting suddenly, and close to Jud. "Now
I'll give ye the thrashing I promised yesterday."</p>

<p>His big fist shot out, making a grab for young
Jeffers.</p>

<p>But Hal Overton caught the wrist of that
hand, and shoved it back.</p>

<p>"That doesn't look exactly manly in you,
Branders," remarked Hal quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't, hey?" roared Tip. "What
have you got to say about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular," admitted Hal pleasantly.
"Nothing, except that I'd rather see you
tackle some one nearer your own size."</p>

<p>"Would, hey?" roared Tip. "O. K!"</p>

<p>With that he swung suddenly, and so unexpectedly
that the blow caught Hal Overton unawares,
sending him to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"I believe I'll take a small hand in this," murmured
Noll Terry, starting to take off his coat.</p>

<p>But Hal was up in a twinkling.</p>

<p>"Leave this to me, please, Noll," he begged,
and sailed in.</p>

<p>Tip Branders was waiting, with an ugly grin
on his face. He was far bigger than Hal, and
stronger, too. Yet, for the first few moments,
Tip had all he could do to ward off Hal's swift,
clever blows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Tip swung around swiftly, taking the
aggressive.</p>

<p>It seemed like a bad mistake, for now Hal
suddenly drove in a blow that landed on Brander's
nose, drawing the blood.</p>

<p>"Now, I'll fix ye for that!" roared Tip, after
backing off for an instant.</p>

<p>Just as he was about to charge again the big
bully felt a strong grip on his collar, while a
deep, firm voice warned him:</p>

<p>"Don't do anything of the sort, Branders, or
I'll have to summon an officer to take you in."</p>

<p>Tip wheeled, to find himself looking into the
grizzled face of Chief of Police Blake. Tip
often bragged of his political "pull," but he
knew he had none with this chief.</p>

<p>"I got a right to smash this fellow," blustered
Tip. "He hit me."</p>

<p>"I'll wager you hit him first, though, or else
gave young Overton good cause for hitting
you," smiled the chief. "I know Overton, and
he's the kind of boy his neighbors can vouch for.
I don't know as much good of you. But I'll tell
you, Tip, how you can best win my good opinion.
Take a walk&mdash;a good, brisk walk&mdash;straight down
the street. And start now!"</p>

<p>Something in the police chief's voice told Tip
that it would be well to obey. He did so.</p>

<p>"Too many young fellows like him on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
street," observed Chief Blake, with a quiet
smile. "Good morning, boys."</p>

<p>At the next corner Hal and Noll turned.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to see Sergeant Wright?"
asked Jud.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Hal. "Our last visit to him."</p>

<p>"Then you won't want us along," said Jud
sensibly. "But say, we wish you barrels of luck&mdash;honest&mdash;in
the new life you're going into."</p>

<p>"Thank you," laughed Hal good-humoredly,
holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Send me a brass button soon, one that you've
worn on your uniform blouse, will you?" begged
Jud.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Hal, "if there's nothing in the
regulations against it."</p>

<p>"And you, Noll? Will you do as much for
me?" begged Tom.</p>

<p>"Surely, on the same conditions," promised
Noll Terry.</p>

<p>"But we haven't succeeded in getting into the
service yet, you must remember," Hal warned
them.</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks!" retorted Jud. "I wish I were
as sure of anything that I want. The recruiting
officer'll be tickled to death when he sees you
two walking in on him."</p>

<p>"I hope you're a real, true prophet, Jud,"
replied Hal, with a wistful smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither of these two younger boys had any
idea how utterly Hal Overton had set his heart
on entering the service, nor why. The reader
will presently discover more about the surging
"why."</p>

<p>On one of the side streets the boys paused before
the door of a cozy, little cottage in which
lived Sergeant Wright and the wife who had
been with him nearly the whole of his time in
the service.</p>

<p>Ere they could ring the bell the door opened,
and Sergeant Wright, U. S. Army, retired,
stood before them, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," was the kindly greeting of this
fine-looking, middle-aged man, "have you settled
the whole matter at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Hal happily. "We go to New
York, to-morrow, to try our luck with the recruiting
officer."</p>

<p>"Come right in, boys, and we'll have our final
talk about the good old Army," cried the retired
sergeant heartily.</p>

<p>It was that same afternoon that Tip Branders
next espied Jud and Tom coming down a street.
Tip darted into a doorway, intent on lying in
wait for the pair.</p>

<p>As they neared his place of hiding, however,
Tip heard Jud and Tom talking of something
that changed his plan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's that?" echoed Tip to himself, straining
his hearing.</p>

<p>"Say," breathed Tom Andrews fervently,
"wouldn't it be fine if we could go to New York
to-morrow morning, too, and see Hal and Noll
sworn into the United States Army?"</p>

<p>Tip held his breath, listening for more. He
heard enough to put him in possession of practically
all of the plans of Hal and Noll.</p>

<p>"Oho!" chuckled Tip, as he strode away from
the place later. "So that pair of boobs are going
to try for the Army. Oh, I daresay they'll
get in. But so will I&mdash;and in the same company
with them. I wouldn't have missed this for anything.
I'll be the thorn in Hal Overton's side
the little while that he'll be in the service! I've
more than to-day's business to settle with that
stuck-up dude!"</p>

<p>All of which will soon appear and be made
plain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>AT THE RECRUITING OFFICE</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE solemn time came the following morning.</div>

<p>Both Hal and Noll were "only children,"
or, at least, so thought their mothers.</p>

<p>Messrs. Overton and Terry, the elders, gave
their sons' hands a last strong grip. No good
advice was offered by either father at parting.
That had already been attended to.</p>

<p>Naturally the boys' mothers cried a good bit
over them. Both mothers, in fact, had wanted
to go over to New York with their sons. But
the fathers had objected that this would only
prolong the pain of parting, and that soldiers
in the bud should not be unfitted for their beginnings
by tears.</p>

<p>So Hal and Noll met at the station, to take an
early morning train. There were no relatives to
see them off. Early as the hour was, though,
Jud Jeffers and Tom Andrews had made a point
of being on hand.</p>

<p>"We wanted to see you start," explained Jud,
his face beaming and eyes wistful with longing.
"We didn't know what train you'd take, so
we've been here since half-past six."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"We may be back by early afternoon,"
laughed Hal.</p>

<p>"Not you two!" declared Jud positively.
"The recruiting officer will jump right up,
shake hands with you, and drag you over to
where you sign the Army rolls."</p>

<p>The train came along in time to put a stop to
a long conversation.</p>

<p>As the two would-be soldiers stepped up to
the train platform Jud and Tom did their best
to volley them with cheers.</p>

<p>Noll blushed, darting into a car as quickly
as he could, and sitting on the opposite side of
the train from these noisy young admirers.</p>

<p>Hal, however, good-humoredly waved his
hand from a window as the train pulled out.
Then, with a very solemn face, all of a sudden,
young Overton crossed and seated himself beside
his chum.</p>

<p>Neither boy carried any baggage whatever.
If they failed to get into the Army they would
soon be home again. If they succeeded in enlisting,
then the Army authorities would furnish
all the baggage to be needed.</p>

<p>"Take your last look at the old town, Hal,"
Noll urged gravely, as the train began to move
faster. "It may be years before we see the
good old place again."</p>

<p>"Oh, keep a stiff upper lip, Noll," smiled Hal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
though he, also, felt rather blue for the moment.
"Our folks will be down to the recruit drilling
place to see us, soon, if we succeed in getting
enrolled."</p>

<p>It hurt both boys a bit, as long as any part of
their home city remained in sight. Each tried
bravely, however, to look as though going away
from home had been a frequent occurrence in
their lives.</p>

<p>By the time that they were ten miles on their
way both youngsters had recovered their spirits.
Indeed, now they were looking forward with almost
feverish eagerness to their meeting the recruiting
officer.</p>

<p>"I hope the Army surgeon doesn't find anything
wrong with our physical condition," said
Hal, at last.</p>

<p>"Dr. Brooks didn't," replied Noll, as confidently
as though that settled it.</p>

<p>"But Dr. Brooks has never been an Army
surgeon," returned Hal. "He may not know all
the fine points that Army surgeons know."</p>

<p>"Well we'll know before the day is over,"
replied Noll, with a catching of his breath.
"Then, of course, we don't know whether the
Army is at present taking boys under twenty-one."</p>

<p>"The law allows it," declared Hal stoutly.</p>

<p>"Yes; but you remember Sergeant Wright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
told us, fairly, that sometimes, when the right
sort of recruits are coming along fast, the recruiting
officers shut down on taking any minors."</p>

<p>"I imagine," predicted Hal, "that much more
will depend upon how we happen, individually,
to impress the recruiting officer."</p>

<p>In this Hal Overton was very close to being
right.</p>

<p>The ride of more than two hours ended at last,
bringing the young would-be soldiers to the
ferry on the Jersey side. As they crossed the
North River both boys admitted to themselves
that they were becoming a good deal more nervous.</p>

<p>"We'll get a Broadway surface car, and that
will take us right up to Madison Square," proposed
Noll.</p>

<p>"It would take us too long," negatived Hal.
"We can save a lot of time by taking the Sixth
Avenue "L" uptown and walking across to
Madison Square."</p>

<p>"You're in a hurry to have it over with?"
laughed Noll, but there was a slight tremor in
his voice.</p>

<p>"I'm in a hurry to know my fate," admitted
Hal.</p>

<p>Oliver Terry had been in New York but once
before. Hal, by virtue of his superiority in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
having made four visits to New York, led the
way straight to the elevated railroad. They
climbed the stairs, and were just in time to board
a train.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they got out at Twenty-third
Street, crossed to Fifth Avenue and Broadway,
then made their way swiftly over to Madison
Square.</p>

<p>"There's the place, over there!" cried Noll,
suddenly seizing Hal's arm and dragging him
along. "There's an officer and a man, and the
soldier is holding a banner. It has something
on it that says something about recruits for the
Army."</p>

<p>"The man you call an officer is a non-commissioned
officer&mdash;a sergeant, in fact," Hal replied.
"Don't you see the chevrons on his
sleeve?"</p>

<p>"That's so," Noll admitted slowly. "Cavalry,
at that. His chevrons and facings are
yellow. It was his fine uniform that made me
take him for an officer."</p>

<p>"We'll go up to the sergeant and ask him
where the recruiting office is," Hal continued.</p>

<p>Certainly the sergeant looked "fine" enough
to be an officer. His uniform was immaculate,
rich-looking and faultless. Both sergeant and
private wore the olive khaki, with handsome
visored caps of the same material.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The early April forenoon was somewhat
chilly, yet the benches in the center of the square
were more than half-filled by men plainly "down
on their luck." Some of these men, of course,
were hopelessly besotted or vicious, and Uncle
Sam had no use for any of these in his Army uniform.
There were other men, however, on the
seats, who looked like good and useful men who
had met with hard times. Most of these men on
the benches had not breakfasted, and had no assurance
that they would lunch or dine on that
day.</p>

<p>It was to the better elements among these men
that the sergeant and the private soldier were
intended to appeal. Yet the sergeant was not
seeking unwilling recruits; he addressed no man
who did not first speak to him.</p>

<p>In the tidy, striking uniforms, their well-built
bodies, their well-fed appearance and their
whole air of well-being, these two enlisted men
of the regular army must have presented a
powerful, if mute, appeal to the hungry unfortunate
ones on the benches.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Sergeant," spoke Hal, as
soon as the two chums had reached the Army
pair.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>"You're in the recruiting service?" Hal continued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Always the invariable "sir" with which the
careful soldier answers citizens. In the Army
men are taught the use of that "sir," and to
look upon all citizens as their employers.</p>

<p>"Then no doubt you will direct us to the recruiting
office in this neighborhood?" Hal went
on.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," answered the sergeant, and
wheeling still further around he pointed north
across the square to where the office was situated.</p>

<p>"You can hardly miss it, sir, with the orderly
standing outside," said the sergeant, smiling.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," Hal agreed. "Thank you very
much, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"You're welcome, sir. May I inquire if you
are considering enlisting?"</p>

<p>"Both of us are," Hal nodded.</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it, sir," the sergeant continued,
looking both boys over with evident approval.
"You look like the clean, solid, sensible, right
sort that we're looking for in the Army. I wish
you both the best of good luck."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Hal acknowledged. "Good
morning, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>Still that "sir" to the citizen. The sergeant
would drop it, as far as these two boys were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
concerned, if they entered the service and became
his subordinates.</p>

<p>It seemed to Hal and Noll as if they could
not get over the ground fast enough until they
reached that doorway where the orderly stood.
The orderly directed them how to reach the
office upstairs, and both boys, after thanking
him, proceeded rapidly to higher regions.</p>

<p>They soon found themselves before the door.
It stood ajar. Inside sat a sergeant at a flat-top
desk. He, too, was of the cavalry. There were
also two privates in the room.</p>

<p>Doffing their hats Hal and Noll entered the
room. Overton led the way straight to the
sergeant's desk.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Sergeant. We have come to
see whether we can enlist."</p>

<p>"How old were you on your last birthday?"
inquired the sergeant, eyeing Hal keenly.</p>

<p>"Eighteen, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"And you?" turning to Noll.</p>

<p>"Seventeen," Noll replied.</p>

<p>"You are too young, I'm sorry to say," replied
the sergeant to Noll.</p>

<p>Then, turning to Hal, he added:</p>

<p>"You may be accepted."</p>

<p>"But I've got another birthday coming very
soon," interjected Noll.</p>

<p>"How soon?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"You'll be eighteen to-morrow?" questioned
the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"That will be all right, then," nodded the
sergeant. "You won't need to be sworn in before
to-morrow. You have both of you parents
living?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal answered, this time.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary, or usual, to say 'sir,'
when answering a non-commissioned officer," the
sergeant informed them. "Say 'sir,' always,
when addressing a commissioned officer or a
citizen."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Hal acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Now, you have the consent of your parents
to enlist?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Both of you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Aldridge!"</p>

<p>One of the pair of very spruce-looking privates
in the room wheeled about.</p>

<p>"Furnish these young men with application
blanks, and take them over to the high desk."</p>

<p>Having said this the sergeant turned back to
some papers that he had been examining.</p>

<p>"You will fill out these papers," Private Aldridge
explained to the boys, after he had led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
them to the high desk. "I think all the questions
are plain enough. If there are any you
don't understand then ask me."</p>

<p>It was a race between Hal and Noll to see
which could get a pen in his hand first. Then
they began to write.</p>

<p>The first question, naturally, was as to the
full name of the applicant; then followed his
present age and other questions of personal history.</p>

<p>For some time both pens flew over the paper
or paused as a new question was being considered.</p>

<p>When he came to the question as to which arm
of the service was preferred by the applicant
Noll turned to Hal to whisper:</p>

<p>"Is it still the infantry?" young Terry asked.</p>

<p>"Still and always the infantry," Hal nodded.</p>

<p>"All right," half sighed Noll. "I'm almost
wishing for the cavalry, though, so I could ride
a horse."</p>

<p>"The infantry is best for our plans," Hal
replied.</p>

<p>When they had finished making out their
papers Hal and Noll went back to the sergeant's
desk.</p>

<p>"Do we hand these to you?" Hal asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the sergeant, taking both papers.
He ran his eyes over them hurriedly, then rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and passed into an inner office. When he came
out all he said was:</p>

<p>"Take seats over there until you're wanted."</p>

<p>Two or three minutes later a buzzer sounded
over the sergeant's head. Rising, he entered the
inner room.</p>

<p>"Our time's come, now, I guess," whispered
Noll.</p>

<p>"Or else something else is going to happen,"
replied Hal, smiling. "You and I are not the
only two problems with which the Army concerns
itself."</p>

<p>Noll's guess was right, however. The sergeant
speedily returned to the outer office and
crossed over to the boys, who rose.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Shackleton will see you," announced
the sergeant. "Step right into his
office. Stand erect and facing him. Use the
word, 'sir,' when answering him, and be very
respectful in all your replies. Let him do all
the talking."</p>

<p>"We understand, thank you," nodded Hal.</p>

<p>The sergeant, who had his cap in his hand,
turned to leave the office for a few moments on
other business. As he was going out he nearly
bumped into a heavily-built young fellow who
was entering.</p>

<p>Hal Overton had reached the door leading
into the lieutenant's office and pulled it open.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as he did so he heard a rather familiar
voice behind him demand:</p>

<p>"Where's the officer in charge?"</p>

<p>"In that office," replied one of the soldiers,
pointing.</p>

<p>The newcomer did not stop to thank the soldier,
but sprang toward the door that Hal had
just opened.</p>

<p>"Here, you kids can stand aside until a man
gets through with his business in there," exclaimed
Tip Branders, gripping Hal by the
shoulders and swinging him aside.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE ORDEAL OF EXAMINATION</h3>


<div class='cap'>HAL OVERTON was so astonished that
he offered no resistance to the bully
from home.</div>

<p>Instead, Hal and Noll paused by the door,
while Tip, with a confident leer on his face,
strode into the inner office.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Shackleton, a man of twenty-eight,
in blue fatigue uniform, with the single bar of
the first lieutenant on his shoulder-straps, looked
up quickly and in some amazement.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I've come to see you about enlisting in the
Army," continued Tip, who, with his hat still
on, was marching up to the desk.</p>

<p>"Take off your hat."</p>

<p>"Eh? Huh?"</p>

<p>"Take off your hat!" came the repeated order,
with a good deal more of emphasis.</p>

<p>"Hey? Oh, cert. Anything to oblige," assented
Tip, with a sheepish grin, as he removed
his hat.</p>

<p>"Is your name Overton?" asked the recruiting
officer, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'glacing'">glancing</ins> at the papers before him.</p>

<p>"Naw, nothing like it," returned Tip easily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or, Terry?"</p>

<p>"Them two boobs is outside," returned Tip,
with evident scorn. "I told 'em to stand aside
until I went in and had my rag-chew out with
you."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Shackleton flashed an angry look
at Branders, though a keen reader of faces
would have known that this experienced recruiting
officer was trying hard to conceal a smile.
The lieutenant had dealt with many of these
"tough" applicants.</p>

<p>"Orderly!" rasped out the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Private Aldridge appeared in the doorway,
standing at attention.</p>

<p>"Orderly, I understand that this man wishes
to enlist&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's dead right," nodded Tip encouragingly.</p>

<p>"But his application has not been received
by me," continued the lieutenant, ignoring the
interruption. "Take him outside and let Sergeant
Wayburn look him over first. Also ask
the sergeant to inform this man as to the proper
way to approach and address an officer."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied Private Aldridge.
He tried to catch Tip's eye, but Branders was
not looking at him, so the soldier crossed over
to Branders, resting a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Come with me," requested the soldier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hey?" asked Tip.</p>

<p>"My man, go with that orderly," cried Lieutenant
Shackleton, in an annoyed tone.</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, all right," nodded Tip, and went
out with the soldier.</p>

<p>"Overton! Terry!" called the recruiting
officer.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," answered Hal, as both boys entered
the room.</p>

<p>"One of you close the door then come here,"
directed Lieutenant Shackleton.</p>

<p>Noll closed the door, after which both boys
advanced to the roll-top desk behind which the
lieutenant sat.</p>

<p>"You are Henry Overton and Oliver Terry?"
asked the officer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal answered.</p>

<p>"And these are <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'you'">your</ins> applications?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You have filled them out truthfully, in every
detail?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You, Overton, are already eighteen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you, Terry, will be eighteen years old
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;&mdash;" from Noll.</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked them both over keenly,
as if to make up his own mind about their ages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I speak, sir?" queried Hal.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To satisfy any doubt about our ages, sir, we
have brought with us copies of our birth certificates,
both certified to by the city clerk at
home."</p>

<p>"You're intelligent lads," exclaimed the officer,
with a gratified smile. "You go at things
in the right way. Be good enough to turn over
the certificates to me."</p>

<p>Hal took some papers from his pocket, passing
two of them over to the recruiting officer, who
examined the certificates swiftly.</p>

<p>"All regular," he declared. "Terry, of
course, if he passes, cannot be sworn in until to-morrow.
You have other papers there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal admitted. "The consent for
our joining, signed by both our fathers and
mothers, since we are under twenty-one."</p>

<p>"But I cannot know, until I have ascertained,
that these are the genuine signatures of your
parents. That investigation will take a little
time."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir," Hal answered, laying the
two remaining papers before the officer, "but
you will find both papers witnessed under the
seal of a notary public, who states that our parents
are personally known to him."</p>

<p>"Well, well, you are bright lads&mdash;good enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to make soldiers of," laughed Lieutenant Shackleton
almost gleefully, as he scanned the added
papers.</p>

<p>"May I speak, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We can't claim credit for bringing these
papers. We are well acquainted with a retired
sergeant of the Army, who suggested that these
papers, in their present form, would save us a
lot of bother."</p>

<p>"Then you don't deserve any of the credit?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You deserve a higher credit, then, for you
are both honest lads."</p>

<p>Again the lieutenant turned to look them over
keenly, sizing them up, as it were. Both were
plainly more than five-feet-four, and so would
not be rejected on account of height. They
seemed like good, solid youngsters, too.</p>

<p>"Smoke cigarettes?" suddenly shot out the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"No, sir!"</p>

<p>"Smoke anything else, or chew tobacco? Or
drink alcoholic beverages?"</p>

<p>"We have never done any of these things,
sir," Hal replied.</p>

<p>"I see that you express a preference for the
infantry," continued the recruiting officer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am almost sorry for that," continued the
officer. "I would like to see two lads of your
evident caliber going into my own arm of the
service&mdash;the cavalry."</p>

<p>"We have chosen the infantry, sir," Hal explained,
"because we will have more leisure time
there than in the cavalry or artillery."</p>

<p>"Looking for easy berths?" asked Lieutenant
Shackleton, with a suddenly suspicious ring to
his voice.</p>

<p>"No, sir," Hal rejoined. "May I explain,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; go ahead."</p>

<p>"We both of us have hopes, sir, if we can get
into the Army, that we may be able to rise to be
commissioned officers. We have learned that
there is less to do in the infantry, ordinarily, and
that we would therefore have more time in the
infantry for study to fit ourselves to take examinations
for officer's commissions."</p>

<p>"Then, to save you from possible future disappointment,
I had better be very frank with
you about the chances of winning commissions
from the ranks," said the lieutenant. "In the
Army we have some excellent officers who have
risen from the ranks. Each year a few enlisted
men are promoted to be commissioned officers.
The examination, however, is a very stiff
one. Out of the applicants each year more enlisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
men are rejected than are promoted. The
difficulty of the examination causes most enlisted
men to fail."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. We have thought of all
that, and have looked over the nature of the examinations
given enlisted men who seek to be
officers," Hal replied. "We know the examinations
are very hard, but we have twelve years
if need be in which to prepare ourselves for the
examination. Enlisted men, so I am told, may
apply for commissions up to the age of thirty."</p>

<p>"Yes; that is right," nodded the lieutenant.
"But how much schooling have you behind
you?"</p>

<p>"We have each had two years in High School,
sir."</p>

<p>"On that basis you will both have hard times
to prepare yourselves for officers' examinations.
However, with great application, you may make
it&mdash;if you achieve also sufficiently good records
as enlisted men."</p>

<p>This explanation being sufficient, Lieutenant
Shackleton paused, then went on:</p>

<p>"As you are unusually in earnest about enlisting
I fancy that you want to hear the surgeon's
verdict as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, if you please," replied Hal.</p>

<p>"Orderly!"</p>

<p>One of the two soldiers entered. Lieutenant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Shackleton made some entries on the application
papers, then handed them to the soldier.</p>

<p>"Orderly, take these young men to the surgeon
at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Come this way, please."</p>

<p>Hal and Noll were again conducted into the
outer office. The sergeant had returned by this
time and was at his desk. Over at the high desk
stood Tip Branders, making out his application.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're it, aren't we?" demanded Tip,
looking around with a scowl at the chums.
"You freshies!"</p>

<p>"Be silent," ordered the sergeant looking up
briskly.</p>

<p>"Well, those two kids&mdash;&mdash;" began Tip. But
the sergeant, though a middle-aged man, showed
himself agile enough to reach Tip Branders'
side in three swift, long bounds.</p>

<p>"Young man, either conduct yourself properly,
or get out of here," ordered the sergeant
point-blank.</p>

<p>Muttering something under his breath, Tip
turned back to his writing, at which he was making
poor headway, while the orderly led Hal and
Noll down the corridor, halting and knocking at
another door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" called a voice.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Shackleton's compliments, sir,
and two applicants to be examined, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good, Orderly," replied Captain Wayburn,
assistant surgeon, Army Medical Corps,
as he received the papers from the orderly.
The latter then left the room, closing the door
behind him.</p>

<p>"You are Overton and Terry?" questioned
Captain Wayburn, eyeing the papers, then turning
to the chums, who answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Captain Wayburn, being a medical officer of
the Army, wore shoulder straps with a green
ground. At the ends of each strap rested the
two bars that proclaimed his rank of captain.
Being a staff officer, Captain Wayburn wore
black trousers, instead of blue, beneath his blue
fatigue blouse. Moreover, the black trousers of
the staff carried no broad side stripe along the
leg. The side stripe is always in evidence along
the outer leg side of the blue trousers of the
line officer, and the color of the stripe denotes
to which arm of the service the officer belongs&mdash;a
white stripe denotes the infantry officer,
while a yellow stripe distinguishes the cavalry
and a red stripe the artillery officer.</p>

<p>Captain Wayburn now laid out two other sets
of papers on his desk. These were the blanks
for the surgeon's report on an applicant for
enlistment.</p>

<p>At first this examination didn't seem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
amount to much. The surgeon began by looking
Hal Overton's scalp over, next examining
his face, neck and back of head. Then he took
a look at Hal's teeth, which he found to be perfect.</p>

<p>"Stand where you are. Read this line of letters
to me," ordered the surgeon, stepping
across the room to a card on which were ranged
several rows of printed letters of different sizes.</p>

<p>Hal read the line off perfectly.</p>

<p>"Read the line above."</p>

<p>Hal did so. He read all of the lines, to the
smallest, in fact, without an error.</p>

<p>"There's nothing the matter with your vision,"
remarked Captain Wayburn, in a pleased
tone. "Now tell me&mdash;promptly&mdash;what color is
this?"</p>

<p>The surgeon held up a skein of yarn.</p>

<p>"Red," announced Hal, without an instant's
hesitation.</p>

<p>"This one?"</p>

<p>"Green."</p>

<p>"And this?"</p>

<p>"Blue."</p>

<p>And so on. Hal missed with none of the colors.</p>

<p>"Go to that chair in the corner, Overton, and
strip yourself, piling your clothing neatly on the
chair. Terry, come here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Noll went through similar tests with equal
success. By the time he had finished Hal was
stripped. Now came the real examination.
Hal's heart and other organs were examined;
his skin and body were searched for blemishes.
He was made to run and do various other exercises.
After this the surgeon again listened to
his heart from various points of examination.
Finally Hal was told to lie down on a cot. Now,
the examination of the heart was made over
again in this position. It was mostly Greek to
the boy. When the examination was nearly
over Noll was ordered to strip and take his turn.</p>

<p>When it was over Captain Wayburn turned
to them to say:</p>

<p>"If I pronounced you young men absolutely
flawless in a physical sense, it wouldn't be much
of an exaggeration. You are just barely over
the one hundred and twenty pound weight, but
that is all that can be expected at your age."</p>

<p>"You pass us, sir," asked Hal eagerly.</p>

<p>"Most decidedly. As soon as Terry is
dressed I'll hand you each your papers to take
back to the recruiting officer."</p>

<p>Five minutes later Hal and Noll returned to
the main waiting room.</p>

<p>"Pass?" inquired the sergeant, with friendly
interest.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Hal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Tip Branders was sitting in a chair, a dark
scowl on his face.</p>

<p>"Orderly, take Branders to the surgeon,
now," continued the sergeant, and Tip disappeared.
Then the sergeant knocked at the
door of the lieutenant's office and entered after
receiving the officer's permission. He came out
in a moment, holding the door open.</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry, the lieutenant will see
you now."</p>

<p>Hal and Noll entered, handing their papers
back to Lieutenant Shackleton, who glanced
briefly at the surgeon's reports.</p>

<p>"I don't see much difficulty about your enlisting,"
smiled the officer. "I congratulate you
both."</p>

<p>"We're delighted, sir," said Noll simply.</p>

<p>"Now, Overton, I can let you sign, provisionally,
to-day but I can't accept your friend, Terry,
until to-morrow, when he will have reached the
proper age for enlisting. This may seem like
a trivial thing to you, but Terry is just one day
short of the age, and the regulations provide that
an officer who knowingly enlists a recruit below
the proper age is to be dismissed from the service.
Now, if you prefer, Overton, you can delay
enlisting until to-morrow, so as to enter on
the same date with your friend."</p>

<p>"I'd prefer that, sir," admitted Hal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>.</p>

<p>"You are both in earnest about enlisting?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we are, sir," breathed Noll fervently.</p>

<p>"I believe you," nodded the officer. "Now,
have you money enough for a hotel bed and
meals until to-morrow forenoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then be here at nine o'clock to-morrow
morning, sharp, and I'll sign you both on the
rolls of the Army. Now, furnish me with home
references, and, especially, the name of your last
employer. These will be investigated by telegraph.
Also, are you acquainted with the chief
of police in your home city?"</p>

<p>Hal and Noll answered these questions.</p>

<p>Then, having nothing pressing on his hands
for the moment, Lieutenant Shackleton offered
the boys much sound and wholesome advice as
to the way to conduct themselves in the Army.
He laid especial stress upon truthfulness, which
is the keystone of the service. He warned
them against bad habits of all kinds, and told
them to pick their friends with care, both in and
out of the service.</p>

<p>"In particular," continued the lieutenant,
"I want to warn you against contracting the
'guard-house habit.' That is what we call it
when a soldier gets in the habit of committing
petty breaches of discipline such as will land
him in the guard-house for a term of confinement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for twenty-four hours or more. The
'guard-house habit' has spoiled hundreds of
men, who, but for that first confinement, would
have made admirable soldiers. The enlisted
man with the 'guard-house habit' is as useless
and hopeless as the tramp or the petty thief in
civil life."</p>

<p>It was an excellent talk all the way through.
Both boys listened respectfully and appreciatively.
It struck them that Lieutenant Shackleton
was giving them a large amount of his time.
They learned, later, that a competent officer is
always willing and anxious to talk with his men
upon questions of discipline, duty and efficiency.
It is one of the things that the officer is expected
and paid to do.</p>

<p>By the time they came out Tip was just returning
from the surgeon's examination.</p>

<p>"You freshies needn't think ye're the only
ones that passed," growled Tip in a low voice,
as he passed.</p>

<p>Neither chum paid any heed to Branders.
Somehow, as long as he kept his hands at his
sides, Branders didn't seem worth noticing.</p>

<p>"Make it?" asked the sergeant at the street
door.</p>

<p>"Yes; we sign to-morrow, if our references
are all right," Hal nodded happily.</p>

<p>With a sudden recollection that soldiers must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
hold themselves erect, Hal and Noll braced their
shoulders until they thought they looked and
carried themselves very much as the sergeant
did. They kept this pose until they had turned
the corner into Broadway.</p>

<p>"Whoop!" exploded the usually quiet Noll
Terry unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, old fellow?" asked Hal
quickly.</p>

<p>"Nothing! Everything's right, and we're
soldiers at last!" cried Noll, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>"At least, we shall be to-morrow, if all goes
well," rejoined Hal.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! Everything is going to go
right, now. It can't go any other way."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Noll turned to cross Broadway
at the next corner.</p>

<p>Hal made a pounce forward, seizing his comrade
by an arm. Then he backed like a flash,
dragging Noll back to the sidewalk with him.
Even at that a moving automobile brushed
Noll's clothes, leaving a layer of dirt on them.</p>

<p>"Things will go wrong, if you don't watch
where you're going," cried Hal rather excitedly.
"Noll, Noll, don't try to walk on clouds, but remember
you're on Broadway."</p>

<p>"Let's get off of Broadway, then," begged
young Terry. "I'm so tickled that I want a
chance to enjoy my thoughts."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll cross and go down Broadway, then,"
Hal proposed. "I have the address of a hotel
with rates low enough to suit our treasury, and
it's some blocks below here."</p>

<p>"Say," muttered Noll, "of all the things I
ever heard of! Think of Tip Branders wanting
to serve the Flag!"</p>

<p>The boys talked of this puzzle, mainly, until
they reached their street and crossed once more
to go to the hotel. They registered, went to
their room, and here Noll put in the next twenty
minutes in making his clothes look presentable
again.</p>

<p>"If you've got that done, let's go downstairs,"
proposed happy Hal. "I'm hungry
enough to scare the bill of fare clear off the
table."</p>

<p>As they descended into the lobby Hal suddenly
touched Noll's arm and stood still.</p>

<p>"I guess Tip is going to stay right with us,"
whispered Overton in his chum's ear. "That's
Tip's mother over there in the chair. She and
her son must be stopping at this hotel."</p>

<p>"They surely are," nodded Noll, "for there's
Tip himself just coming in."</p>

<p>Neither mother nor son noted the presence
of the chums near by.</p>

<p>Tip hurried up to his mother, a grin on his
not very handsome face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, old lady," was that son's greeting,
"I've gone and done it."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you've gotten into any
trouble, do you, Tip?" asked his mother apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Trouble&mdash;nothing!" retorted Tip eloquently.
"Naw! I've been around to the rookie shed and
got passed as a soldier in the Regular Army."</p>

<p>"What?" gasped his mother paling.</p>

<p>"Now, that ain't nothing so fierce," almost
growled Tip. "But there is a fool rule&mdash;me
being under twenty-one&mdash;that you've got to go
and give your consent. So that's the cloth that's
cut for you this afternoon, old lady."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" cried Mrs. Branders, sinking
back in her chair and covering her face with
her hands. "What have I ever done that I
should be disgraced by having a son of mine going
to&mdash;enlist in the Army!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MRS. BRANDERS GETS A NEW VIEW</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE chums waited to hear no more. It
was none of their affair, so they slipped
into one of the adjacent dining rooms.</div>

<p>Hal's eyes were flashing with indignation
over Mrs. Brander's remark.</p>

<p>Noll, on the other hand, was smiling quietly.</p>

<p>"That must be a severe blow to Mrs. Branders,"
murmured Noll aloud, as the boys slipped
into their chairs at table. "To think of gentle
Tip going off into anything as rough and brutal
as the Army! And poor little Tip raised so
tenderly as a pet!"</p>

<p>As it afterwards turned out, however, Mrs.
Branders, after offering her son a present of
a hundred dollars to stay out of the Army, had
at last tearfully given her consent to his becoming
a soldier.</p>

<p>She even went to the recruiting office that
afternoon with Tip, and gave a reluctant consent
to her son's enlistment.</p>

<p>"Be here at nine o'clock, sharp, to-morrow
morning," directed Lieutenant Shackleton.</p>

<p>It was doubtful if either youngster slept very
well that night. Both were too full of thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the Army and of the service. When Hal did
dream it was of Indians and Filipinos.</p>

<p>Both were up early, and had breakfast out
of the way in record time&mdash;and then they hurried
to Madison Square. They reached there
ten minutes ahead of time.</p>

<p>The sergeant, however, came along five minutes
later, and admitted them to the recruiting
office.</p>

<p>Hardly had they stepped inside when Tip and
his mother also appeared. Then came the other
enlisted men stationed at this office. Punctually
at the stroke of nine Lieutenant Shackleton
entered, lifted his uniform cap to Mrs. Branders
and entered his own inner office.</p>

<p>"Now you kids will get orders to skin back
home," jeered Tip, in a low tone, as he glanced
over at Hal and Noll.</p>

<p>"No pleasantries of that sort here," directed
the sergeant, glancing up from his desk.</p>

<p>The door of the inner office opened, and Lieutenant
Shackleton stepped out.</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry, your references prove
to be absolutely good. I will enlist you presently."</p>

<p>Then the officer moved over to where Tip
Branders and his mother sat. Tip rose awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Branders, I'm sorry to say we must decline<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
your enlistment," announced the recruiting
officer, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Wot's that?" demanded Tip unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"I find myself unable to accept you as a recruit
in the Army," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Why, wot's the matter?" demanded Tip,
thunderstruck. "Didn't I get by the sawbones
all right?"</p>

<p>"If you mean the surgeon, yes," replied the
recruiting officer. "But I regret to say that
we do not receive satisfactory accounts of you
from the home town."</p>

<p>"Wot's the matter? Somebody out home trying
to give me the crisscross?" demanded Tip
indignantly.</p>

<p>"We do not receive a satisfactory account of
your character, Branders, and therefore you
are not eligible for enlistment," went on
Shackleton. "Madam, I am extremely sorry,
but the regulations allow me to pursue no other
course in the matter. I cannot enlist your
son."</p>

<p>"See here, officer&mdash;&mdash;" began Mrs. Branders
hoarsely, as she got upon her feet.</p>

<p>"When addressing Mr. Shackleton, call him
'lieutenant,' not 'officer,'" murmured one of the
orderlies in her ear.</p>

<p>"You mind your own business," flashed Mrs.
Branders, turning her face briefly to the orderly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Then she wheeled, giving her whole attention
to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"See here, officer, do you mean to say that
my boy ain't good enough to get into the
Army?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry, madam, but the report we receive
of his character isn't satisfactory," answered
Shackleton quietly.</p>

<p>"What? My boy ain't good enough to go
with the loafers and roughs in the Army?"
cried Mrs. Branders angrily. "He's too good
for 'em&mdash;a heap sight too good for any such
low company! But s'posing Tip has been just
a little frisky sometimes, what has that got to
do with his being a soldier? I thought you
wanted young fellows to fight&mdash;not pray!"</p>

<p>"The soldier who can do both makes the better
soldier, madam," replied the lieutenant,
feeling sorry for the mother's humiliation.
"And now I will say good morning to you and
your son, madam, for I am very busy to-day.
Overton and Terry, come into my office."</p>

<p>Before turning, Lieutenant Shackleton bowed
to Mrs. Branders as gracefully and courteously
as he could have done to the President's wife.
Then he started for his office, leaving Mrs.
Branders and Tip to depart in bewilderment and
anger.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll followed the lieutenant, trying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not to let their faces betray any feeling over
Tip's troubles.</p>

<p>"You still wish to enlist?" asked Shackleton,
turning to the waiting lads, after he had
seated himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered both.</p>

<p>"Then you will sign the rolls," directed the
recruiting officer, passing papers forward, dipping
a pen in ink and passing it to Hal.</p>

<p>Hal signed, slowly, with a solemn feeling. It
was Noll's turn next.</p>

<p>"I will now administer the oath," continued
Lieutenant Shackleton gravely, as he rose at his
desk. "Raise your right hand, Overton, and
repeat after me."</p>

<p>This was the oath of service that Hal repeated:</p>

<p>"'I Henry Overton, do solemnly swear that I
will bear true faith and allegiance to the United
States of America; that I will serve them honestly
and faithfully against all their enemies
whomsoever; and that I will obey the orders of
the President of the United States, and the orders
of the officers appointed over me, according
to the rules and articles of war.'"</p>

<p>Then Noll took the same oath.</p>

<p>"You have already signed the same oath as
a part of your enlistment contract," continued
Lieutenant Shackleton. "I have now to certify<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that you have taken the oath and signed before
me."</p>

<p>Seating himself once more the recruiting officer
certified in the following form on each set
of papers:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Subscribed and duly sworn to before me this &mdash; day
of &mdash;&mdash; , A. D. &mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"<span class="smcap">Thomas P. Shackleton</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"First Lieutenant, 17th Cavalry,</span><br />
"Recruiting Officer."<br />
</div></div>

<p>"That is all," finished the recruiting officer.
"You are now recruits in the United States
Army. I wish you both all happiness and success.
You will take your further orders from
my sergeant, or from the corporal to whom he
turns you over. You will probably find yourself
at the recruit rendezvous at Bedloe's Island
in time for dinner to-day."</p>

<p>Touching a button on his desk the lieutenant
waited until the sergeant entered.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, turn these men over to Corporal
Dodds. Come back in ten minutes for the papers."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>The sergeant led them down the corridor,
opening a door and leading the way inside.</p>

<p>"Corporal Dodds, here are two recruits.
Take care of them until I bring the papers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good, Sergeant."</p>

<p>The door closed.</p>

<p>"Help yourselves to chairs, or stand and look
out of the window, if you'd rather," invited
Corporal Dodds, who, himself, was seated at a
small desk.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll tried sitting down at first. This
soon became so irksome that they rose and went
to one of the windows.</p>

<p>Corporal Dodds said nothing until the door
opened once more, and the sergeant entered
with an envelope.</p>

<p>"Here are the papers for Privates Overton
and Terry. You are directed to see that the
young men go with you on the eleven o'clock
ferry to Bedloe's Island. You will report with
these recruits to the post adjutant as usual."</p>

<p>"Very good, Sergeant," replied Corporal
Dodds, and again the boys were alone with their
present guide.</p>

<p>To the raw young recruits it was a tremendously
solemn day, but to the corporal, it was
simply a matter of dry routine.</p>

<p>"Ten-fifteen," yawned the corporal, at last.
"Come along, rookies; nothing like being on time&mdash;in
the Army, especially."</p>

<p>"Rookie" is the term by which a new recruit
is designated in Army slang. It is a term of
mild derision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Corporal Dodds paused long enough at the
recruiting office to turn over his key to the sergeant;
then he led the way to the street, across
to the Sixth Avenue Elevated road, and thence
they embarked on a train bound down town.</p>

<p>All the way to the Battery Corporal Dodds
did not furnish his pair of recruits with more
than a dozen words by way of conversation.</p>

<p>But neither Hal nor Noll felt much like talking.
Though either would have died sooner
than admit it, each was suffering, just then from
acute homesickness, and also from a secret
dread that the Army might not turn out to be
as rosy as they had painted it in their imagination.</p>

<p>"This way to the Army ferry," directed Corporal
Dodds, leading them across the Battery.</p>

<p>Once aboard a small steamer that flew the
flag of the Quartermaster's Department, United
States Army, Corporal Dodds watched his two
young rookies as though he suspected they
would desert if they got a chance.</p>

<p>After the ferry had left the slip, however,
Dodds paid no more heed to them. He at least
left them free to end it all by jumping over into
the bay, if they wished to do so.</p>

<p>Finding that he was under no restrictions,
Private Hal Overton, United States Army,
sauntered forward to the bow. Private Noll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Terry, feeling, if anything a bit more forlorn,
followed him.</p>

<p>Just as they were nearing the dock at Bedloe's
Island, Noll ventured:</p>

<p>"I wonder how Tip Branders feels about
now."</p>

<p>"I wonder," muttered Hal.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>IN THE AWKWARD SQUAD</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONCE they were ashore our young rookies
found Bedloe's Island a very much
larger bit of real estate than it appears
to the passerby on a steamboat.</div>

<p>It was, in fact, a long walk from the dock to
the adjutant's office at headquarters.</p>

<p>"Hit up the stride, rookies," ordered Corporal
Dodds. "Double-time march&mdash;hike.
Don't keep the post adjutant from his luncheon."</p>

<p>Corporal Dodds' real reason for haste was
that he had a crony in one of the squad rooms
at barracks whom he wanted to see as early as
possible.</p>

<p>Shortly the rookies and their guide entered
the adjutant's office. The adjutant proved to
be a captain of infantry with a corporal and
two privates on duty in his office as clerks.</p>

<p>"Sir, I report with two recruits," announced
Corporal Dodds, coming to a salute, which the
adjutant returned.</p>

<p>"Their papers?" asked the adjutant.</p>

<p>"Here, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good, Corporal. You may go."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to the chums Captain Anderson
asked:</p>

<p>"You are Overton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal replied, doing his best to
salute as neatly as Corporal Dodds had. Again
the adjutant returned the salute in kind. "Then
you are Terry?" he asked, turning.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Noll returned, not omitting to
salute.</p>

<p>The adjutant called to his principal clerk.</p>

<p>"Corporal, make the proper entries for these
men. Then take them over to Sergeant Brimmer's
squad room."</p>

<p>With that the adjutant picked up his uniform
cap and left the office, all the enlisted men present
rising and standing at attention until he
had closed the door after him.</p>

<p>The corporal made the necessary entries, then
rose and picked up his own uniform cap.</p>

<p>"Come with me, rookies," he directed briefly.</p>

<p>So Hal and Noll followed, feeling within them
another surge of that curiously lonely and depressed
feeling.</p>

<p>This corporal led them into the barracks
building, and down a corridor on the ground
floor. He paused, at last, before a door that he
flung open. Striding into the room, the corporal
looked about him.</p>

<p>"Where is Sergeant Brimmer?" he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not here now," replied another corporal,
coming forward.</p>

<p>"Two rookies. Hand 'em over to Brimmer
when he comes in," replied the conductor from
the adjutant's office.</p>

<p>With that he strode out again, shutting the
door after him.</p>

<p>The last corporal of all proved to be an older
man than any of his predecessors. He appeared
to be about thirty-five years old; he was tall,
dark-featured and rather sullen-looking.</p>

<p>In this room there were twenty cot beds, arranged
in two opposite rows, with their heads
to the walls. On each cot the bedding had been
rolled back in a peculiarly exact fashion.</p>

<p>At the further end of the squad room was a
table and several chairs.</p>

<p>The occupants of the room, at this moment,
were a dozen men, besides the corporal. Three
of the men, like our young rookies, were still
wearing the clothes in which they had enlisted.
The others wore light blue uniform trousers and
fatigue blouses of dark blue. Some of these
men in uniform looked almost indescribably
"slouchy." They were men who had received
their uniforms, but who had not yet had enough
of the setting-up drills to know how to wear
their uniforms.</p>

<p>"What are you looking about you for?" demanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the corporal. "Wondering why dinner
ain't spread on that table yonder?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Hal quietly. "We're just
waiting to be told what to do with ourselves."</p>

<p>"What do I care what you do with yourselves?"
demanded the corporal, turning on his
heel and walking away.</p>

<p>So Hal and Noll remained where they were,
the feeling of loneliness growing all the time.</p>

<p>"Don't mind Corporal Shrimp any more than
you have to," advised one of the uniformed
rookies, coming over to them after a few moments.
"Shrimp is a terror and a grouch all the
time. Sergeant Brimmer you'll find a real old
soldier, and a gentleman all the time."</p>

<p>"Then it's just our luck to find Sergeant
Brimmer out," smiled Hal.</p>

<p>"Here he comes now," murmured the uniformed
rookie, as the door of the squad room
opened.</p>

<p>At the first glimpse of the newcomer Hal
made up his mind that he was going to like Sergeant
Brimmer. He was a man of about thirty,
tall, rather slender, erect, thoroughly well built,
with light, almost golden hair and mustache,
and a keen but kindly blue eye.</p>

<p>"Recruits?" he asked, as he approached the
boys.</p>

<p>Both answered in the affirmative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Corporal Shrimp," called Brimmer, "have
you no report to make to me about these new
men?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," answered Shrimp, coming from
the further end of the room. "These men have
just been brought here from the adjutant.
They're assigned to your squad room."</p>

<p>"Very good, Corporal. Men, what are your
names?"</p>

<p>Hal and Noll both answered.</p>

<p>"Friends?" asked Sergeant Brimmer.</p>

<p>"Chums," Hal stated.</p>

<p>"Then you'll be bunkies, too, of course. You
want beds together, don't you?"</p>

<p>"If we may have them," Noll answered.</p>

<p>"Follow me, then. Here you are. Eight and
nine will be your beds until further orders.
Later, when you have your clothing issued,
Corporal Shrimp or I will show you how
and where to take care of it. Now, men, you'll
likely find it a bit dull here for a day or two.
Recruits generally do. Then that will all wear
off, and you'll be glad you're in the Army. If
there's anything you need to know, ask Corporal
Shrimp"&mdash;Hal winced inwardly&mdash;"or
me. The mess call will soon go for dinner.
When it does, follow me outside, but take your
places in the rear of A Company, which is the
recruit company that you now belong to. I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
show you where to stand. New recruits don't
march with the battalion&mdash;not until they've been
drilled enough to know how to march."</p>

<p>"Is there a battalion here, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Two recruit companies, at present. The
non-commissioned officers, of course, are trained
soldiers. Then there are a few old-time privates
in each company&mdash;just enough to give the recruits
some steadiness. The trained privates
also act as instructors sometimes."</p>

<p>With this remark Sergeant Brimmer moved
away.</p>

<p>"He's all right," murmured Noll Terry. "If
all were like Sergeant Brimmer we wouldn't
feel so lonely and blue."</p>

<p>Noll had let that last word escape him without
thinking. But Hal, who felt just as blue,
pretended not to have heard.</p>

<p>"It'll all look different to us, just as soon as
we get into uniform, and get past the first
breaking-in," predicted young Overton.</p>

<p>Ta-ra-ra-ra-ta! sounded a bugle, out in the
corridor.</p>

<p>"That must be the call to dinner," muttered
Hal.</p>

<p>But a uniformed recruit, passing them,
stopped to say, pleasantly:</p>

<p>"No; that's first call to mess. Every call by
the bugler has a 'first call,' sounded just a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
while before. That 'first call' is always just the
same strain. But the real call differs, according
to what is meant. The mess call itself, which is
the one you'll hear next, sounds like this."</p>

<p>The recruit hummed mess call for them.</p>

<p>"Thank you," acknowledged Hal gratefully.</p>

<p>"Feeling lonesome?" asked the uniformed
rookie.</p>

<p>"J-j-just a bit," assented Hal.</p>

<p>"I'm getting almost over it," smiled the uniformed
one, "The older men, those who have
seen service with a regiment, tell me that a man
soon gets to find delight in being in the Army.
But that's after he has gotten away from the
recruit rendezvous."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll get over it before then," promised
Hal. "We'll be all over it by to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Look out for that Shrimp," whispered the
uniformed rookie.</p>

<p>"Does anyone ever need that warning, after
seeing the corporal and hearing him talk?"
laughed Hal, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Don't you rookies go to take this squad-room
for a vawdy-vill show," growled Corporal
Shrimp, from the near distance, as he heard the
three laughing. Sergeant Brimmer had just
stepped outside.</p>

<p>Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta! sounded a bugle again in the
corridor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little time to ourselves now," whispered
the uniformed recruit. "That's mess call."</p>

<p>The men in the room were quickly filing out.
Outside of barracks A Company was falling in,
with B Company to the left of it.</p>

<p>"You un-uniformed recruits take your position
at the rear, without forming," ordered Sergeant
Brimmer coming up. "As your company
starts Corporal Shrimp will instruct you how
to form at the rear of the company."</p>

<p>What followed was little understood by the
two recruits. But presently the two first sergeants
gave their commands, and marched their
companies into the mess hall.</p>

<p>"Fall in lively, there, by twos!" growled
Shrimp roughly. "Hurry up! Don't get in
the way of the head of B Company!"</p>

<p>To give emphasis to his orders Shrimp seized
Hal and Noll each by an arm and swung them
into place.</p>

<p>Both recruits went in with flushed faces.
Shrimp's treatment had been such as to make
them feel uncomfortably "raw." But as the
men marched to their seats at the long tables in
the mess hall this feeling of humiliation left both
boys.</p>

<p>Hal's new friend occupied a seat at their
right.</p>

<p>"All the corporals ain't Shrimps," he whispered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
"We've probably got one of the meanest
corporals in the Army."</p>

<p>"He knows how to make everyone else feel as
mean as himself," Hal whispered back.</p>

<p>Then all hands fell to at the meal, which tasted
uncommonly good. It consisted of a stew, with
plenty of meat and potatoes, and other vegetables
in it. There was also bread and butter.
Pie and coffee followed. Then the recruit companies
were marched out again and were dismissed.</p>

<p>"We have twenty minutes for relaxation
now," laughed Hal's new friend, who had introduced
himself as Private Stanley. "After that
I suppose Shrimp will get you for the setting-up
drills. He always has the new men in our squad
room. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment Sergeant Brimmer stepped
up to the trio as they stood in the open air chatting.</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry, you'll be under Corporal
Shrimp's orders after the recreation period.
He'll instruct you in some of the first work of
the recruit. Go with him when he orders you
to turn out."</p>

<p>"Very good, Sergeant."</p>

<p>No sooner had a bugle sounded than Corporal
Shrimp appeared, followed by two other
un-uniformed rookies walking behind him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"You, Overton, and you, Terry, fall in by
twos behind these two raw rookies," ordered
Shrimp. "Try to act a bit as though you were
marching, at that. Don't be too dumb! Forward!"</p>

<p>Conscious that they were not cutting much
of a figure, Hal and Noll followed the pair ahead
of them.</p>

<p>Shrimp led them to a bit of green some distance
away from any of the larger drill grounds.</p>

<p>"Squad halt!" he rumbled. "Now, rookies,
you'll fall in in single rank, facing the front
and about four inches apart. No, no, ye idiots!"
as the four rookies started confusedly to
obey. "You'll wait until I give the order 'fall
in.' When I do, Overton, being the tallest, will
take his place at the right, Terry next him, then
Strawbridge, and then Healy. Now, rookies,
d'ye think ye understand? And you'll take
your places about four inches apart&mdash;just
enough distance to allow each man the free use
of his body. Fall in!"</p>

<p>So confused were the poor rookies under the
scowling glances of Shrimp that, in their haste
to obey, they nearly upset each other.</p>

<p>"Ye're a bad lot," commented the corporal,
eyeing them with extreme disfavor. "You
don't even know how to judge the interval between
each man. Now, let every man except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the man at the left rest his left hand on his hip,
just below where his belt would be if he wore
one. Let the right arm hang flat at the side.
Now, each man move up so that his right arm
just touches his neighbor's left elbow. Careful,
there! Don't crowd. Now, let your left arms
fall flat. There, you ostriches, you have the interval
from man to man as well as rookies can
get it inside of a week. Now, each one of you
note his interval from the man at his right. So.
Fall out!"</p>

<p>Without moving the rookies stood looking
uncertainly at Corporal Shrimp.</p>

<p>"Fall out, I say!" roared the corporal.</p>

<p>"Do we go back to the squad room?" asked
one of the rookies.</p>

<p>"Listen to the man, now!" growled Shrimp.
"Do you go back to the squad room! You'll
be lucky if ye ever live to see the squad room
again. Fall out&mdash;fall out of ranks, ye idiots!"</p>

<p>"Oh," answered the same rookie. "Why
didn't you say so?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't I say so?" roared Shrimp.
"Why didn't I say so, indeed! Ye'll take the
order the way I give it&mdash;not the way ye want
it. When I tell ye to fall in, that means to get
into line, with the proper interval from man to
man. When I say fall out, ye're to get out of
ranks again. Now, then&mdash;fall in!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>In a twinkling the recruits jumped to obey.
Shrimp surveyed their alignment with a scowl.
Nothing that a recruit could do would satisfy
him.</p>

<p>"Left hand on the hips, again. Now, get the
interval&mdash;get it!" roared Shrimp. "Dress up
there, ye rookie idiots!"</p>

<p>Shrimp would have made an excellent drillmaster
had he possessed the patience and the
human decency of Sergeant Brimmer. But this
corporal made his work doubly hard, and hindered
the rookies from learning, by his persistent
nagging and bad temper.</p>

<p>"Now, we'll see whether ye can do as well at
learning the position of the soldier," he snapped
out nastily, after a while. "Whenever, in barracks,
or elsewhere, in ranks or out, if you hear
the command, 'Attention,' ye'll come to the position
of the soldier. Now, watch me, ye thick-pated
rookies, and, as I describe it, bit by bit,
I'll come to the position of the soldier."</p>

<p>After lounging for an instant Corporal
Shrimp continued:</p>

<p>"Heels on the same line, and as near together
as possible. Turn your feet out equally so that
they form an angle of sixty <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'degress'">degrees</ins>."</p>

<p>Then, straightening up, this irate drillmaster
went on:</p>

<p>"Hold your knees straight, but don't have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
'em stiff. Keep your body erect on the hips,
but inclined ever so little forward; keep your
shoulders squared, and let 'em fall equally.
Let your arms and hands hang naturally, with
the backs of the hands outward and the little
fingers almost touching the seams of your trousers
legs. Keep your elbows near the body.
Head erect and square to the front. Draw yer
chin in slightly, but don't hold it as if it was
glued there, and keep yer eyes straight to the
front."</p>

<p>Corporal Shrimp illustrated excellently in his
own person. But then he glared at the rookies
and shouted, "Attention!"</p>

<p>Of course none of the rookies did it just right.</p>

<p>"Fall out! Overton, ye lobster, come on the
carpet before me, and I'll teach ye or make ye
crazy!"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the carpet?" asked Hal, staring dubiously.
His head was tired from the corporal's
badgering, or he would have been brighter.</p>

<p>"On that spot!" glared Shrimp, pointing at
the grass about six feet in front of him, and
adding an oath that made Hal's face flush. But
young Overton obeyed, nevertheless. Shrimp
scolded and hounded, but Hal did his best to
keep his patience and really learn. Then it was
Noll's turn. Terry came in for a worse badgering
than ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye bandy-legged griddle-greaser!" snarled
Shrimp, beside himself. "Is that what ye call
letting yer arms hang naturally. Where did ye
get yer ideas of nature, anyway, ye spindle-shanked
carpenter's apprentice?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Brimmer had stepped within view,
though behind the corporal's back, and stood
looking quietly on.</p>

<p>"Ye wart on an Army buzzard!" howled
Shrimp. "Ye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do, Corporal," broke in Sergeant
Brimmer quietly. "You're relieved, Corporal.
I have time to take over the squad myself. You
may go to the squad room."</p>

<p>Shrimp turned with a glare, but with the
snarl somehow dying on his lips. He gasped
with anger and humiliation, then turned about
and stalked away toward barracks.</p>

<p>During the next hour things went along very
differently. Sergeant Brimmer was an alert
drillmaster, and he permitted no lagging or indifference
on the part of the recruits. Neither
did he hesitate to single out any rookie who did
a thing improperly. But the sergeant's method
of drilling was wholly manly. He was patient,
even if firm, and he called no rookie uncomplimentary
names.</p>

<p>"Fall out," ordered the sergeant presently.
"Sit down if you want to, men, or walk about.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
And I'll answer any questions that you may
want to ask me out of ranks."</p>

<p>"What a difference between non-coms," uttered
Hal to Noll, as the two chums stepped
away a few yards. "Sergeant Brimmer is a
man, first of all. I'd cheerfully drill under him
until I dropped."</p>

<p>"Non-com" is the abbreviation used in the
Army for non-commissioned officer&mdash;a corporal
or sergeant.</p>

<p>"I hope we don't have to have much to do
with Shrimp," muttered Noll Terry. "And I
hope we don't find many Shrimps in the
Army."</p>

<p>"Fall in!" sounded Sergeant Brimmer's
voice, at last. How the young rookies sprang to
obey, their eyes shining with interest!</p>

<p>Sergeant Brimmer now began to explain the
"rests." Next he came to the salute. For
some minutes he drilled them in the first principles
of marching. But brief rests were frequent,
and during these rests he answered all
questions put to him.</p>

<p>"Fall in!" he shouted once more. The rookies
fell in as eagerly as before. "Squad, attention!"</p>

<p>At that instant a far-off bugle sounded.</p>

<p>"That closes this period of instruction," announced
the sergeant. "Dismissed!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>As the four broke out of ranks Hal approached
their instructor respectfully.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, 'dismissed' means that we're
through, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Overton. And this squad is dismissed
until supper time. You can return to squad
room, or you may remain about out-doors, if
you'd rather. Don't go far away from barracks,
though."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Hal replied, and turned away
with Noll.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE TROUBLE WITH CORPORAL SHRIMP</h3>


<div class='cap'>"I DON'T want to say or think anything disloyal,"
laughed Noll, as the two chums
turned in at barracks, "but I wish
Shrimp would desert."</div>

<p>"I wish we could have Sergeant Brimmer to
teach us all the time," returned Hal. "I can't
believe that Corporal Shrimp is any good to
the service."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be any good if I had to stand
around for a fellow like Shrimp all the time,"
Noll answered. "How different it is when we
are under a real soldier like the sergeant."</p>

<p>Corporal Shrimp was alone in the squad room
when the two chums entered. The corporal was
scowling sulkily until he caught sight of Hal and
Noll.</p>

<p>"Come over to yer beds, ye two blamed rookies!"
ordered Shrimp, jumping up. "I'll be
bound ye know nothing yet of how to fold yer
bedding."</p>

<p>"No, we don't," replied Hal, with an outward
respect that he was far from feeling.</p>

<p>"Then watch me, bandy-legs, while I put yer
bed down in regulation style."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Shrimp quickly threw the bedding down on
Hal's cot. With the deft hands of the trained
soldier Shrimp made the bed up with neatness
and dispatch.</p>

<p>"And in the morning, after first call to reveille,"
continued the Corporal, "ye'll turn yer
mattress up&mdash;so. And fold and lay the bedding&mdash;so.
Now, let's see ye shake down yer bed and
make it."</p>

<p>This task Hal performed rather well for the
first time trying. But Shrimp found a lot of
fault, volubly, then finally shoved Hal Overton
aside and finished the bed-making with a few
deft touches.</p>

<p>"Now, turn up yer mattress, and fold yer bedding,"
ordered the corporal.</p>

<p>Hal started patiently to obey, but there was
no pleasing Shrimp. He vented a couple of
oaths, evidently in order to make the matter
clearer.</p>

<p>"Now, do it over again," ordered Shrimp
roughly.</p>

<p>"This fellow is venting his spite on us because
he's angry at the way Sergeant Brimmer relieved
him this afternoon," thought Hal hotly.
Yet he tried patiently to follow out his instructions.</p>

<p>In the meantime four or five other recruits
had entered the squad room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here ye gibbering monkey! Not that
way!" snarled Shrimp. "Stand aside!"</p>

<p>Seizing Hal by the shoulders Shrimp deliberately
hurled him out into the middle of the squad
room. Hal did not fall, but he wheeled about,
his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>Corporal Shrimp stood surveying him angrily.</p>

<p>"Making faces at me, are ye, ye Army-lawyer?"
howled Shrimp, springing toward
Hal.</p>

<p>He launched a blow full at the young rookie.
Private Overton, who had some knowledge of
boxing and of its companion foot-work, stepped
aside.</p>

<p>But as Shrimp recovered and prepared to
launch another blow, Hal Overton threw his
hands up at guard.</p>

<p>Then recollecting that he was a private soldier,
under discipline, Hal let his hands fall uselessly
at his side, while a hot flush of shame
mounted to his brow.</p>

<p>"Going to hit me, were ye?" sneered Shrimp,
in an ugly tone. "It's well ye didn't! Now,
stand where ye are till I take some of the conceit
out of ye!"</p>

<p>Shrimp raised his right fist deliberately.</p>

<p>"Corporal!"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking that crisp tone. It
was one of sharp command. Sergeant Brimmer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
who had just opened the door and looked
in, now came striding down the squad room.</p>

<p>"Corporal, stand at attention!"</p>

<p>Shrimp wheeled about, coming to the position
of the soldier as he faced the sergeant. But
the corporal's countenance was still as black as
thunder. Sergeant Brimmer, too, was thoroughly
angry, though righteously so.</p>

<p>"Corporal Shrimp, you're in arrest for striking
at and humiliating a private soldier. Come
with me to the company commander."</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Sergeant," began Shrimp
hoarsely, "you don't know what I have to put
up with with these rookies. I have to do something
to keep discipline among men who are new
to barracks. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue and come with me," insisted
Sergeant Brimmer crisply.</p>

<p>There was no disregarding that angry, authoritative
tone. As the sergeant wheeled
Shrimp turned and went with him, as though
stricken suddenly dumb.</p>

<p>"Good enough!" rose a cry, as the door closed
on the two non-coms.</p>

<p>"Got what he needs," muttered some one else.</p>

<p>"I hope he stays in arrest," added another
rookie. "This squad room was a good deal like
a madhouse when the sergeant wasn't here."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes went by before the door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
opened to admit Sergeant Brimmer on his return.</p>

<p>"Now, men, come close. I want to tell you a
few things," began the sergeant. "The first is
this. No non-commissioned officer has any right
to swear at any of you. It is in violation of
regulations. If any non-commissioned officer
calls you vile names, or swears at you, it is your
right, and your duty, too, to report it to the non-commissioned
officer in charge of the squad
room. If he fails to take heed of your complaint,
then go to the first sergeant of the company.
If he fails to heed your complaint, then
go to the company commander. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>The recruits nodded.</p>

<p>"Second," pursued Sergeant Brimmer, "no
non-commissioned officer has any right to strike
you, unless it be strictly in self-defense, or in defense
of an officer who is threatened by you.
You have the same remedy of complaint, if any
non-commissioned officer strikes you, or lays
violent hands on you, as in the case of vile or
profane language. Is that clear."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant," came from all sides.</p>

<p>"Any questions?" asked Sergeant Brimmer,
looking about him.</p>

<p>"Has any officer any right to direct bad language
at an enlisted man, or to strike him?"
queried Noll.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"The officer has no more right than anyone
else, except in an emergency of danger to himself
or others," replied Sergeant Brimmer.
"But there's this difference: I've been in the
Army fourteen years, and I never knew an officer
to degrade himself in that fashion. But occasionally
a non-commissioned officer will so disgrace
himself. Either the officer or non-commissioned
officer who swears at or strikes an
enlisted man may be court-martialed, and, if
it is found that he is guilty, he is dismissed
from the service."</p>

<p>"We've had an awful lot to put up with from
Corporal Shrimp, Sergeant," announced one of
the uniformed recruits.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you have, men. But I don't
want you to carry tales to me. Tale-bearing is
never worth while, nor encouraged, in the Army.
Corporal Shrimp's case is now before the commanding
officer. To-night or to-morrow an officer
will be here to take the complaints of any of
you men who have grievances. You will be <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ex-expected'">expected</ins>
to complain to the officer only about
wrongs that have been done you by Corporal
Shrimp. The officer will not permit any tale-bearing
about anything that happened to anyone
else. Corporal Shrimp is now in another
squad room, under arrest. He will probably be
court-martialed. In any case he won't return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
here until his case has been thoroughly disposed
of."</p>

<p>The door opened, and a corporal of twenty-five
years, or under, entered, striding straight
up to Brimmer.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, I am directed by the company commander
to report to you for quarters and duty
here," announced the newcomer.</p>

<p>"Very good, Corporal Davis. I will assign
you to your cot at once."</p>

<p>The new corporal was speedily assigned, after
which the sergeant left the room on duty.</p>

<p>"Are there any new recruits here who do not
fully understand the care of their bedding?"
inquired Corporal Davis pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I do not, Corporal," Hal answered.</p>

<p>"Nor do I," came from Noll.</p>

<p>"Which are your beds, then?" asked Davis
promptly.</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes both Hal and Noll
knew how to make beds, and how to fold them
away for the day.</p>

<p>Davis proved to be a younger edition of the
sergeant. He was not familiar with the recruits,
but taught what he was there to teach,
and did it with a mingling of firmness and patience.</p>

<p>"From policing of quarters in the morning
until tattoo at night," went on Corporal Davis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
"you are not allowed to take down your bedding
and make up the bed, except under orders
for purposes of instruction. At tattoo you may
make up your bed and turn in promptly, if
you wish. At taps you must have your bed
made, and get into it at once. Any man up
after taps, except by permission, is subject to
discipline."</p>

<p>Supper call came soon after. When the evening
meal was finished our young rookies found
that they had the evening to themselves. They
could stay in squad room, or could go out into
the open, if they preferred, though, as rookies,
they could not roam as they pleased over the
whole post.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll elected to take a stroll after
supper.</p>

<p>"Hal," proposed Noll, "I want to ask you
something."</p>

<p>"Permission granted," laughed Private Overton.</p>

<p>"Do you think you're going to like the Regular
Army as much as you expected!"</p>

<p>"Yes, siree," replied Hal promptly, and with
enthusiasm. "Shrimp was hard to swallow, and
he would have made this place purgatory to
us. But he was caught, red-handed, and we've
had a lesson, the first day in the service, that
real justice rules always in the Army. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
breaking-in as recruits, Noll, is going to be
harder than I thought, even if we have such
fine men as Brimmer and Davis all the time.
But, after we get through that period, and at
last know our duties and understand the life,
we're going to be mighty glad that we took the
oath and enlisted under the Flag."</p>

<p>"It's mighty good to hear you say that," replied
Noll Terry almost gratefully. "But I'm
afraid we have a fearful lot ahead of us to learn.
It will take an awfully long time to learn all
we have got to know, I fear."</p>

<p>"A recruit generally stays about three months
at the rendezvous," Hal went on. "After that
he's drafted to his regiment, sent away to join
it, and then he's a real soldier at last."</p>

<p>"With still a lot to learn, though," added
Noll.</p>

<p>"Yes," Hal assented. "I imagine that the
real soldier always learns as long as he remains
in the service."</p>

<p>After a long walk, doubling back and forth
over some roads and paths several times, our
young rookies found themselves looking at the
water by the Jersey end of the island.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we'd be allowed to go over there
by the water's edge!" suggested Hal. "It
would be fine to sit down there and hear the
waves lap up against the shore. I don't want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to go in yet, Noll, but I am tired enough to want
to sit down."</p>

<p>"Here comes some one in uniform," murmured
Noll.</p>

<p>It was a sergeant passing, though one the
rookies had not seen before.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," called Hal, "may I ask you a
question?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered the sergeant, halting
and regarding them.</p>

<p>"We're rookies; just joined to-day," continued
Hal. "We were wondering if it would
be any breach of discipline for us to go over
there by the shore and sit down near the water
for a while."</p>

<p>"There's no rule against it," replied the sergeant.
"But I'd advise you to be back before
taps, for it generally takes a recruit some time
to get his bed made right."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sergeant. We'll be sure to go
back in time."</p>

<p>As the sergeant passed on Hal and Noll headed
for the shore.</p>

<p>"Here's as good a place as any, Noll," said
Hal, as they reached the shore. He pointed to
a little depression in the ground. There was a
little rise of ground before them as they threw
themselves down flat, though it did not wholly
shut off their view of the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Little waves lapped up monotonously against
the beach.</p>

<p>"My, but that's a sound to make one drowsy,"
laughed Noll contentedly.</p>

<p>"We mustn't let it have that effect on us,"
uttered Hal, half in alarm. "I am tired, but it
would never do to fall asleep here and be late
at tattoo. I don't know what kind of scrape
that would get us into."</p>

<p>"Do you know," went on Noll, "this day's
doings all seem like parts of a dream to me.
I can't realize, yet, that I'm a soldier. I suppose
it's because we haven't our uniforms yet."</p>

<p>"That has something to do with it, of course,"
nodded Hal. "I thought this a pretty good suit
of clothes when I left home, but now I feel actually
shabby and fearfully awkward when I look
about me at older recruits in their snappy uniform.
It'll really seem like a big load off my
mind, Noll, when I find myself in the blue."</p>

<p>"The fellows tell me that a rookie generally
has his first issue of uniform in about three
days," said Noll. "That won't be so very long
to wait."</p>

<p>"Won't it, though?" almost grumbled Hal.
"Any time at all is too long to wait, when we've
been dreaming so long about wearing the uniform."</p>

<p>"Why, we'd be a discredit to the uniform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
at present," smiled Noll. "Think how awkward
we looked and felt, and were to-day. It
seemed as though it were going to be simply
impossible to learn the first steps of a soldier's
business."</p>

<p>"We'll learn faster, now," suggested Hal;
"now that Shrimp has gone out of our lives."</p>

<p>"<i>Has</i> he gone out of our lives, I wonder?"
mused Noll.</p>

<p>"Say," hinted Hal, "I'd have given a lot to
have seen Tip Branders drilling under Shrimp."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose we'll be very likely to see
Tip again, for some years," suggested Noll.</p>

<p>In this he was in error, as will presently appear.</p>

<p>"How's the time running along, I wonder?"
was Noll's next thought.</p>

<p>Hal drew his watch from a pocket, laid it on
the ground, and struck a match, screening the
blaze with his hands.</p>

<p>"We've nearly an hour yet," Overton answered.</p>

<p>"I don't know but we'd better go back before
we have to," ventured Noll. "Hullo, there's a
boat out there, putting in this way."</p>

<p>Though neither of the boys knew it some of
the glow of the burning match had been visible
in the darkness out on the water, and this boat
was coming in answer to a fancied signal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to watch that boat a bit," whispered
Hal in his chum's ear.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't believe it has any right to land
here at night. Any boatman here on honest
business ought to go around to the dock, I
think."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" breathed Noll.</p>

<p>"Don't make any noise, anyway."</p>

<p>It was very dark, but the rookies could see a
small rowboat head into the beach just a little
way below them. There was one man in the
boat, and he promptly sounded a low, cautious
whistle. It was answered from behind the
young recruits, somewhere. Then the sound of
steps.</p>

<p>Some one was approaching, and the boatman,
standing up in his craft, listened, then called in
a low voice:</p>

<p>"That you, Sim?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Good!" answered the boatman. "I got
your word, 'phoned from New York. I've got
cit clothes for you in the boat, also a weight to
sink your uniform with, when you make the
change."</p>

<p>Now the newcomer trod down straight past
the place of concealment of the boys. Something
in his figure was wholly familiar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, that's Corporal Shrimp!" called Hal,
springing up and running down toward the
shore. Noll followed his chum on the instant,
both arriving at once.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you rookies want here?" demanded
Shrimp, turning upon them with an
oath.</p>

<p>"I guess we're here on duty," clicked Hal
resolutely. "You're supposed to be in arrest,
Corporal, and here you are leaving the post on
the sly!"</p>

<p>"I'm out of arrest, and on duty. Stand
aside!" snarled Shrimp, his look becoming very
ugly.</p>

<p>"Is it a kind of duty that calls for you to
sneak away in this fashion, put on citizen's
clothes, and sink your uniform in the bay?" demanded
Private Overton mockingly. "If you
tell me that, Corporal, I don't believe you."</p>

<p>Corporal Shrimp uttered another ugly oath.
Then, with a flashing movement, he drew a
service revolver from under his blouse and
thrust the muzzle almost in Private Overton's
face.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>WHEN THE GUARD CAME</h3>


<div class='cap'>"LOOK out, Sim Shrimp!" called the boatman
quickly, warningly.</div>

<p>For, while Hal had stood looking
gamely at the revolver, Noll Terry had side-stepped,
and now leaped at the corporal.</p>

<p>Whack! Noll struck up the glinting barrel
of the weapon.</p>

<p>Private Overton, seeming to move in the same
instant, leaped forward in front.</p>

<p>Bang! The revolver was discharged, but
harmlessly into the air, as both rookies tackled
the corporal and bore him to the ground.</p>

<p>"Help, here, Bill!" cried Shrimp, as he found
himself going over backward.</p>

<p>The boatman leaned over to snatch up an oar.
As he rose with it he saw Private Hal Overton
rise with the corporal's revolver in his hand.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, Corporal, and don't
make any fuss," advised Hal grimly. "Your
friend had better stay where he is if he doesn't
want to know what it feels like to have a bullet
going through him."</p>

<p>"Drop that gun, and let me up! Get out of
my way," ordered Shrimp. "You're interfering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with me in the discharge of my duty, and
I'll put you both in a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>"Don't you try to get up," ordered Noll, who
had thrown himself across the corporal and was
holding him down.</p>

<p>"Sentry!" yelled Hal. "Sentry."</p>

<p>He should have called, "Corporal of the
guard!" but he didn't know that.</p>

<p>Another shot at some distance was heard, followed
by a lusty shout from a sentry of:</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard, post number seven!"</p>

<p>"Let me up out of this, and I'll let you both
off," proposed Corporal Simeon Shrimp.</p>

<p>"You'll stay just where you are," ordered
Hal, "and I give you my word that, if I see any
signs of your trying to escape, I'll drill you
through with all the bullets this revolver carries."</p>

<p>Running feet were now coming rapidly their
way.</p>

<p>"Lemme go&mdash;boys, do," pleaded the corporal
brokenly, terror ringing in his voice. "Boys,
you don't know what fearful trouble you'll get
me into."</p>

<p>"That's a different song," retorted Private
Hal Overton dryly. "But it wouldn't do any
good to let you go now. Your friend has shoved
off, and is rowing like mad."</p>

<p>The steps of running men now came nearer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 293px;">
<img src="images/illus094.png" width="293" height="450" alt="Both Rookies Tackled the Corporal." title="" />
<span class="caption">Both Rookies Tackled the Corporal.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"This way, Corporal of the guard!" called
Private Overton.</p>

<p>In another moment the corporal and two men
of the guard raced to the spot.</p>

<p>"This is Corporal Shrimp. He was under
arrest, and trying to escape," announced Hal.
"There was a friend of his here with a boat,
and he's out yonder now, Corporal, trying to get
away."</p>

<p>"Load with ball cartridge, hail that boat, and
fire if the man doesn't come about promptly
and row in," ordered the corporal, turning to
one of the members of the guard.</p>

<p>The soldier so directed loaded his rifle like
lightning.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy, turn about and come back!"
shouted the soldier.</p>

<p>There was no answer from the water.</p>

<p>"Turn about and come back," repeated the
soldier.</p>

<p>Still no answer. Then, after a third hail, the
soldier raised his rifle to his shoulder, sighting
as best he could in the darkness.</p>

<p>Bang! The rifle spat forth a jet of fire and
sent a bullet whistling over the water.</p>

<p>"Send a couple of more shots after him," ordered
the corporal.</p>

<p>Still no answer from out on the water. And,
by this time, the boat was so far away in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
darkness that it was impossible to judge in which
direction to aim.</p>

<p>"Cease firing. The rascal has escaped," said
the corporal of the guard. "You are recruits,
aren't you?" turning to Hal and Noll.</p>

<p>"Yes, Corporal."</p>

<p>"You're right about Corporal Shrimp being
in arrest. Corporal, you've taken a long chance
in breaking your arrest like this."</p>

<p>Shrimp said not a word. He was cunning
enough to know that nothing he could say now
would help his case any.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the two members of the
guard stepped forward, bringing his rifle to
port.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he called. "Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant of the guard," replied another
voice out of the darkness.</p>

<p>"Advance, Sergeant of the guard, to be recognized."</p>

<p>Not only the sergeant came forward, but four
other members of the guard with him.</p>

<p>"Corporal Shrimp, breaking arrest and attempting
to desert, Sergeant," reported the corporal
of the guard.</p>

<p>"Shrimp, what a fool you've been to-day!"
muttered Sergeant Collins. "Let him up, men.
Hold out your hands, Corporal Shrimp. I've
got to do it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>His face sallow with dread and humiliation,
Shrimp held out his hands, while the sergeant
snapped a pair of handcuffs into place over his
wrists.</p>

<p>"March the prisoner to the guard-house, Corporal,"
directed the sergeant of the guard. Then he turned
to Private Hal, who still held the revolver.</p>

<p>"You two are recruits?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"You stopped the prisoner from escaping?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Where did you get that revolver?"</p>

<p>"It is the one that Corporal Shrimp drew on
us when we attempted to prevent him from
escaping."</p>

<p>"You took it away from him in a scuffle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Mighty fine work for a pair of young recruits,"
declared Sergeant Collins promptly. "Your names?"</p>

<p>Hal and Noll informed the sergeant of the
guard on this point as the sergeant turned on
his way back to the guard-house.</p>

<p>"You'll come with me, Overton and Terry.
The officer of the day will need to hear your
statements."</p>

<p>"We'll not be censured, Sergeant, for being
late at the squad room?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hardly," came the dry retort. "You're
now under orders from the guard. Don't
worry, men."</p>

<p>Shrimp's voice was audible once more. He
was swearing volubly over the trick that fate
had played him.</p>

<p>"Stop that prisoner's swearing," ordered
Sergeant Collins sharply.</p>

<p>In a short time the guard party reached the
post guard-house.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Mayberry, officer of the day, stood
just outside of the door.</p>

<p>"What have you there, Corporal?" asked
Lieutenant Mayberry curiously.</p>

<p>"Corporal Shrimp, sir, for breaking arrest
and attempting to desert, sir," replied the corporal
of the guard, bringing his hand to his
piece in a rifle salute, which the officer of the day
acknowledge by bringing his right hand up to
the visor of his cap.</p>

<p>"Where did you catch him?"</p>

<p>"At the shore, sir, over there," replied the
corporal of the guard, pointing.</p>

<p>"There's no sentry post over there, Corporal."</p>

<p>"No, sir; the prisoner was caught by two
rook&mdash;recruits, sir."</p>

<p>"Two recruits?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Coming, sir, with the sergeant of the
guard."</p>

<p>At this moment Sergeant Collins stepped forward
into the light.</p>

<p>"These are the two recruits, sir, who caught
the prisoner," announced Sergeant Collins, making
the rifle salute.</p>

<p>"Your names and company, men?" asked
Lieutenant Mayberry.</p>

<p>"Private Overton, A Company, sir," replied
Hal, saluting.</p>

<p>"Private Terry, A Company, sir," from Noll.</p>

<p>"How long have you men been on post?"
asked the officer of the guard.</p>

<p>"Since about noon, to-day, sir." Hal was
spokesman this time.</p>

<p>"And you've already started your Army
career by catching a man in the act of desertion?"
cried the lieutenant. "Men, you're beginning
well. Corporal, lock the prisoner in a
cell. Then report to me at my desk. Sergeant,
bring Privates Overton and Terry inside with
you."</p>

<p>Hal and Noll, the sergeant and the corporal
soon stood grouped before the desk of the officer
of the day. Sergeant Collins had turned
over the revolver that Private Hal had taken
from Shrimp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Mayberry listened with very evident
interest as the story of the capture was unfolded
to him.</p>

<p>"Corporal, did you see the boat in question?"
asked the officer of the day, at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, though very indistinctly, in the distance.
It was out of sight in the darkness, an
instant after, sir."</p>

<p>"But there can be no doubt that the boat was
there, Corporal?"</p>

<p>"I am absolutely certain of it, sir," replied
the corporal.</p>

<p>"That is all, now," finished Lieutenant Mayberry.
"Overton and Terry, I am going to
commend you, in an off-hand way, now, for your
judgment and intelligence to-night. You have
made an excellent beginning. You may very
likely hear from the commanding officer later."</p>

<p>At that moment a bugle call was heard.</p>

<p>"That's taps, isn't it?" asked Hal, realizing
for the first time how time had passed at the
guard-house.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sergeant Collins. "Tattoo
went some time ago."</p>

<p>"You won't find yourselves in any trouble,
men," broke in Lieutenant Mayberry, with a
slight smile. "Report to the non-commissioned
officer in charge of your squad room that you
have been at the guard-house under orders."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as dismissed Hal and Noll made a
swift spurt for barracks.</p>

<p>"Too bad, the first night, men," said Sergeant
Brimmer quietly, meeting them just inside
the door of the squad room.</p>

<p>Hal promptly accounted for both himself and
his chum.</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the startled sergeant
softly. "You caught Corporal Shrimp in the
act of deserting? Men, your time to get square
came around soon, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"We didn't do it to get square, Sergeant," replied
Hal. "We did it as a matter of military
duty."</p>

<p>"Well, go softly to your beds, men. I'll go
with you, to see that you make 'em up according
to rule."</p>

<p>As Sergeant Brimmer went back to his own
iron cot he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"Caught Shrimp, and turned him over to the
guard! Those lads are going to make good soldiers.
And it won't pay any comrade to make
enemies of them needlessly."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE CALL TO COMPANY FORMATION</h3>


<div class='cap'>UNIFORMED rookies at last!</div>

<p>How proud each of our young rookies
felt when at last he had a chance to
survey himself in a glass.</p>

<p>Never, it seemed, had uniforms fitted quite as
neatly before.</p>

<p>Never, at all events, had young recruits felt
any keener delight than did Hal and Noll when
they found themselves in their first infantry
uniforms.</p>

<p>From that happy instant they were looked
upon as the two brightest, keenest recruits on
post.</p>

<p>On the first day of their uniformed lives Sergeant
Brimmer came to them.</p>

<p>"You are directed to fall in at parade, this
afternoon, without arms. At formation I will
place you in the rear rank."</p>

<p>Though they had their uniforms, their rifles
had not yet been issued.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" wondered Noll.
"We're not promoted to the company yet.
We're not out of the squad work yet."</p>

<p>"We can wait to find out what it means," Hal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
answered. "It won't be many hours till parade
time, now."</p>

<p>Then, at the bugle call, these young soldiers
hurried outside, where Corporal Davis formed
them and marched them away.</p>

<p>Having finished with the "school of the soldier"
our two rookies were now in the "school
of the squad."</p>

<p>In a company of infantry the squad consists
of seven privates and a corporal. Marching in
column of twos, or in column of fours, the corporal's
place is on the left of the front rank of
the squad; he himself makes the eighth man.
But, for purposes of instructing recruits, the
squad consists of eight rookies and a corporal.</p>

<p>Davis now led them away to the field, where
he halted them.</p>

<p>"We will first," he announced, "take up the
six setting-up drills of the manual, and go
through with them three or four times. You
men will do it as snappily as possible to-day."</p>

<p>These exercises consist of various gymnastic
movements with the arms, of bending until the
hands touch the ground, and of leg-raising
work. The setting-up drills are very similar to
ordinary work without apparatus in a gymnasium&mdash;but
with this difference: the rookie is
made to go through with them more and more
snappily each time that he is set to the work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
The result is that, within a few weeks, an awkward
and perhaps shuffling, shambling young
man is trained and built into the erect, alert,
snappy and dignified soldier.</p>

<p>The setting-up work performed, Corporal
Davis next drilled the rookies in alignments, interval-taking,
marchings, turnings and "about,"
which corresponds to the old-time "about-face."
It might be well to remark that all
military commands in these days, have been
greatly simplified as compared with the old
style of doing things.</p>

<p>Davis was an alert and industrious instructor,
yet he abused none of the men, nor ever lost his
patience. He was making rapid progress with
this squad.</p>

<p>"Fall out," he called, from time to time.</p>

<p>"To-morrow you will have your arms issued
to you," he announced during one of the rests.
"Then you will learn the manual of arms, and
also how to march with arms. Your work will
be harder, but you're being prepared for
harder work now."</p>

<p>By this time Hal and Noll had been in the
Army nearly three weeks. Some of the rookies
in the same squad had been in the service considerably
longer. The length of time that he
remains a recruit depends very much upon the
rookie himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our arms?" said Noll to his chum. "That's
the last step toward being a real soldier."</p>

<p>"No; the last step is when your company commander
pronounces you a qualified private soldier,"
rejoined Hal Overton. "And that's
after you've been drafted into a real regiment,
at that."</p>

<p>The loneliness had all vanished now. Both
Hal and Noll were now wholly in love with the
life, and anxious for the day when they should
be sent forth to their regiment. They had requested
that they be sent to the same regiment,
and had little doubt but that their wish would
be granted.</p>

<p>No longer did the arduous work make them
tired. Instead, the steady, brisk and systematic
exercise left them keen and very much alive
when the command "dismissed" came.</p>

<p>At last a bugle sounded the recall for the
rookie squads. Corporal Davis finished the instruction
in which he was engaged, then called
out:</p>

<p>"Halt! Dismissed."</p>

<p>In an instant the rookies left the ranks, glad
of a bit of play-time before supper.</p>

<p>But Davis called after two of them:</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry, don't forget that you're
under orders to report at company formation
before parade this afternoon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"We won't forget it, Corporal," Hal answered.</p>

<p>"Why are you ordered to company formation?"
asked one of the men of the squad curiously.</p>

<p>"We haven't the least idea," Hal answered
frankly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I can be near enough to find out,"
rejoined the curious one.</p>

<p>"Say," suggested Noll almost excitedly, "it
can't be that we're considered far enough advanced
to turn out with the company?"</p>

<p>"Hardly likely," murmured Hal, "when we
don't know the manual of arms yet."</p>

<p>"Then what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>Yet Hal Overton was certainly decidedly curious,
despite his coolness. Both our young rookies
hung about until they heard first call for
parade. Then they hurried toward the company
parade ground.</p>

<p>Soon the fall-in order was given, and the older
rookies fell in under arms. Sergeant Brimmer,
true to his word, stepped up and placed Hal and
Noll six paces to the rear of the second platoon.</p>

<p>"Obey all orders that do not call for the manual
of arms," was his parting instruction. Then
Brimmer went to his own position.</p>

<p>The company was assembled, roll-call followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and there was a brief inspection of arms.
While this was going on the post adjutant appeared
and took up post.</p>

<p>"Publish the orders," commanded the captain,
at last.</p>

<p>From the breast of his blouse the adjutant
drew forth an official paper. While the men in
ranks stood at order arms, the adjutant read
aloud:</p>

<p>"'For exceptional zeal, intelligence and loyalty
in preventing the escape and attempted desertion
of a prisoner, Recruit Privates Overton
and Terry are hereby commended.'"</p>

<p>This was signed by the post commander.</p>

<p>Now Sergeant Brimmer stepped over to Hal
and Noll with military stride, saying briskly:</p>

<p>"Recruit Privates Overton and Terry dismissed."</p>

<p>That was all. Brimmer was already on his
way back to his own post.</p>

<p>"Was that all we turned out for with the company?"
asked Noll in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it enough?" retorted Hal in an
equally low tone, as they watched the man&oelig;uvres
of the company at a distance.</p>

<p>"There's one thing we didn't get commended
for in that order," Noll went on.</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Well, we had to tackle an armed man when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
we went up against the Shrimp. The order
didn't say anything about courage."</p>

<p>"That's because only exceptional courage is
ever mentioned in orders," Hal explained.
"Any soldier is expected to have courage enough
to face firearms."</p>

<p>When Sergeant Brimmer returned to squad
room after parade he came straight over to Hal
and Noll.</p>

<p>"That was a pretty good thing for you this
afternoon, men," he commented pleasantly. "It
isn't often that a rookie gets commended in orders."</p>

<p>"Does it bring any more pay?" laughed Noll.</p>

<p>"No; but, my man, it goes on your record,
and that's worth something. The commendation
that was read out in orders this afternoon
goes forward to your new colonel, when you're
drafted to a line regiment, and that commendation
becomes a part of your permanent
record in the Army. Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"It's too much," Hal declared, "for such a
little thing as we did."</p>

<p>"You men want promotion, don't you?" asked
Sergeant Brimmer.</p>

<p>"Surely," nodded Noll.</p>

<p>"When you get to your regiment, and your
company commander has occasion to appoint a
new corporal, he looks over the records of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
men in his company. Men, I guess you've each
of you got your first grip on one of the chevrons
that Shrimp dropped."</p>

<p>For Shrimp had been tried by court-martial,
three days before. The findings, verdict and
sentence had been sent on through the military
channels, and would not be published until approved
by the department commander. But no
one at the island doubted that Shrimp would
lose his corporal's chevrons, would be dismissed
the service and sentenced to imprisonment in
addition.</p>

<p>"I'd rather get chevrons, if they're coming
my way, by some other means than pulling them
off another man's sleeves," thought Hal to himself.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>ORDERED TO THE THIRTY-FOURTH</h3>


<div class='cap'>TWELVE working days with arms, and
Privates Overton and Terry were moved
on into A Company.</div>

<p>They were now deeper than ever in the work
of learning the soldier's trade.</p>

<p>A tremendous change had been worked in
them. Though their faces were as youthful as
ever, the boys seemed to have grown into the
dignity of men&mdash;of trained men, at that.</p>

<p>They carried themselves like soldiers, thought
of themselves as soldiers, and were soldiers.
For they loved their work better than ever.</p>

<p>"We need only to get to our regiment now,
to be wholly happy," Noll declared to his chum.
"Oh, why can't more young fellows, droning
their lives out in offices, or tending senseless
machines in shops, understand the joy of this
free, manly life?"</p>

<p>Of course, not all rookies at the post had conceived
as large an idea of Army life.</p>

<p>Two, who had joined at about the same time
as Overton and Terry, had not proved themselves
wholly suited to a life of discipline. This
pair had committed several breaches of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
rules, and had at last been haled before courts-martial
and dismissed the service.</p>

<p>Only the young man who has in him the makings
of a man and a soldier finds the life of the
Army attractive. The incompetent, the shiftless
and the vicious are no better off in the
Army than they would be anywhere else. In
fact they are out of their element.</p>

<p>Shrimp, the sullen, had gone, too, at last.
The order had been published that sent him to
undergo a year's imprisonment for having attempted
to desert.</p>

<p>This corporal had had in him three quarters
of the makings of a good soldier. He had been
promoted once, and fell short of being a soldier
only as he fell short of being a man.</p>

<p>Ahead of any that had joined at about the
same time, Hal and Noll were "warned" for
guard-duty. Sergeant Brimmer gave them the
order, and seemed happy in doing it.</p>

<p>"You men are doing your work splendidly,"
he added briefly. "Read up the manual of
guard-duty for all you're worth before guard-mount
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"I think we know it by heart, already, Sergeant,"
Hal answered.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that in the least. But it can't
do you any harm to read up some more."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sergeant; we'll do it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Guard-mounting is a ceremony of importance
in the Army. It is done to music, where music
is available. Every man who turns out on the
new guard&mdash;which means that he is to be on
duty for the next twenty-four hours&mdash;is expected
to present himself with his person, uniform
and equipments absolutely clean and tidy.
The two men who thus make the most soldierly
appearance are detailed as orderlies at headquarters.
These orderlies do not have to walk
post as sentries, and have in all ways a much
easier time than the other members of the
guard. There is always keen rivalry for the
position of orderly.</p>

<p>On this morning, after the formation of the
guard, and inspection, the post adjutant stepped
forward.</p>

<p>"Privates Denton and Burke will fall out and
report as orderlies," he commanded.</p>

<p>Denton and Burke obeyed, striving hard to
suppress their exultation.</p>

<p>"Orderly detail would have fallen to Privates
Overton and Terry, who present the most soldierly
appearance," continued the adjutant, in
his official tone. "But this is the first tour of
guard duty for Privates Overton and Terry,
and it is considered essential that they first of
all learn to walk post and become familiar with
the duties of sentries."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>At that the glee in the faces of Privates Denton
and Burke faded somewhat. Hal and Noll
tried to keep their own faces expressionless.</p>

<p>Hal Overton never forgot his feelings when he
shouldered his rifle, with bayonet fixed, and patrolled
his first sentry post for two hours.</p>

<p>He felt even more the sense of responsibility
when he came to his first night tour of sentry
duty.</p>

<p>In his way the sentry is a tremendously important
personage. On his post he represents
the whole sovereignty of the United States of
America. The youngest sentry in the Army
may halt and detain any officer, no matter of
how exalted rank, until he is certain that the
man halted is an officer entitled to pass. Of
course, with a sentry of common sense the mere
appearance of the uniform is enough under ordinary
circumstances. But no personage in the
United States may attempt to go by a sentry
without the sentry's permission.</p>

<p>"How'd you enjoy it, Overton?" asked Sergeant
Brimmer, who was sergeant of the guard,
when Hal came in from his tour of night duty.</p>

<p>"I hope I didn't get myself into trouble," Hal
answered.</p>

<p>"How so, lad?"</p>

<p>"I halted the commanding officer of the
post."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was he in uniform?"</p>

<p>"No; in civilian dress. He had been to the
city, I guess, and was coming up from the shore.
It was dark, and I saw only the civilian clothes.
So I challenged him."</p>

<p>"What did the K. O. say?"</p>

<p>"K. O." is the Army abbreviation for "commanding
officer."</p>

<p>"He asked me what I was trying to do?"
smiled Hal. "So I repeated my question,
'who's there,' Then he answered, 'the commanding
officer.' I replied: 'Advance, commanding
officer, to be recognized.' He seemed
uncertain about it, but I made him step right
up to me. When I saw who it was I told him to
proceed."</p>

<p>"Did you hold your gun at port all the time?"
inquired Sergeant Brimmer.</p>

<p>"Yes; until I recognized the commanding
officer. Then I came to present arms, and he
returned my salute, then walked by."</p>

<p>"Your skirts are clear enough, then," nodded
the sergeant of the guard.</p>

<p>"But why did he ask me, so crossly, what I
was trying to do?" asked Hal.</p>

<p>"Why," mused the sergeant, "my own idea
of it is that K. O. was trying you out on purpose.
And I'll wager the K. O. was glad to find
a rook sentry so thoroughly alive to his job.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Though I doubt if you'll get commended in orders
for just being awake. But that reminds
me of something that happened to me, in the
Philippines," laughed Brimmer. "I was sergeant
of the guard out there, and one night the
colonel of another regiment tried to go by our
guard. At that time the law was that no civilian
could be on the streets after half-past eight.
'Twas called the curfew law there.</p>

<p>"Well, Colonel Blank came up in a carriage
at about ten in the evening. He wasn't in uniform,
mind you, lad. Well, the sentry on number
one post, who didn't know the colonel,
stopped his carriage, of course.</p>

<p>"'I'm Colonel Blank,' says the man in the
carriage. 'Corporal of the guard,' calls the
sentry. 'I'm Colonel Blank,' says the man in
the carriage to the corporal of the guard. Now,
the corporal didn't know the colonel either. So
the corporal bawls, 'Sergeant of the guard.'
That was I, that night, and I didn't know the
colonel, either. So I asked: 'Beg your pardon,
sir, but do you know any of the officers of this
command?'</p>

<p>"'Name the officers,' says the man in the carriage.
So I named them.</p>

<p>"'I don't know one of your officers,' says the
man in the carriage.</p>

<p>"'Then I'm sorry, sir,' says I, 'but I'll have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to ask you, sir, to step into our guard-house
until some officer of your regiment comes over
in uniform and identifies you.'</p>

<p>"At that the man in the carriage puts on an
awful scowl, draws himself up very stiff, and
answers, 'I'll do nothing of the sort, Sergeant.'</p>

<p>"'I beg your pardon, sir,' says I, 'but if
you are Colonel Blank, then you know very well,
sir, that you'll have to step inside the guard-house
and wait.'"</p>

<p>Sergeant Brimmer chuckled heartily over the
recollection.</p>

<p>"And did Colonel Blank obey you, and go inside
and wait?" asked Hal.</p>

<p>"Did he?" asked Brimmer, looking surprised.
"Of course he did. What's a guard for in the
Army, if it can't enforce its orders? And it
was past midnight when we finally got an officer,
by telephone, to come over and go bail for
his colonel's identity. Then, of course, we
turned the colonel loose."</p>

<p>"Did he complain against you?" queried
Private Hal.</p>

<p>"Who? Colonel Blank? He's too good a
soldier," laughed Sergeant Brimmer. "And
he's General Blank, now. Before he left, the
colonel complimented me on my fitness for
guard duty."</p>

<p>"A sentry, or a corporal or sergeant of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
guard is a pretty big soldier, isn't he?" smiled
Hal.</p>

<p>"In some ways," nodded the sergeant, "he's
a bigger man than the President. The President
is only the head of the nation, while the
sentry on post is the whole nation itself!"</p>

<p>Noll had the last two hours before daylight
on post that night, but nothing happened to him
except the arrival of the corporal with the relief
just as dawn was breaking.</p>

<p>The days and the weeks sped by rapidly now.
There were always new duties to be learned, but
our young rookies had now picked up the habit
of learning so easily and quickly that everything
seemed a matter of course.</p>

<p>"How do you like Army life now, Noll?" Hal
asked one day.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't swap this life for any other," exclaimed
Private Noll Terry, his eyes shining.
"Hal, have you never suspected that they're
making men out of us here? We're learning
to obey without asking why, and we're being
trained in a way that will fit us to lead other
men one of these days. And look how strong
all the gymnastics with a rifle is making us.
We sleep as we never slept before, and it takes
a heap to make us tired."</p>

<p>"We're eating everything in sight, if that's
a sign of good physical condition," laughed Hal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I wish I could hear the orders sending
us to our regiment," sighed Noll.</p>

<p>"Don't be downspirited," urged Hal, smiling
cheerfully. "Our stay here at the rendezvous
can't last much longer, anyway."</p>

<p>"How long have we been here, anyway?"
Noll wondered.</p>

<p>"Why, we came here early in April and it's
now past the middle of June," Hal went on.
"Let me think. Why, it's just ten weeks to a
day since we took the oath to serve the Flag."</p>

<p>"And a rook generally puts in three months
here&mdash;&mdash;" Noll began, when a soldier, close to
the door of the squad room, called out:</p>

<p>"Attention!"</p>

<p>Instantly every man in the room rose and
wheeled about, standing at the position of the
soldier. An officer, followed by the first sergeant
of A Company, was entering the room.</p>

<p>As the officer came to a halt the first sergeant
called:</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry, step forward."</p>

<p>Hal and Noll approached the officer and the
sergeant, then again stood at attention. The
officer was the post adjutant, and now he spoke:</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry, your company commander
is satisfied that you are now sufficiently
instructed to go to your regiment. We have a
draft for two men for the first battalion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Thirty-fourth Infantry, stationed at Fort
Clowdry, in the Colorado mountains. If you
have any objections to that regiment, or station,
I will listen to them."</p>

<p>"Colorado will very exactly suit me, sir, thank
you," Hal replied, his pleasure showing in his
face.</p>

<p>"And me also, sir," added Noll.</p>

<p>"Very good, then. You will both report to
Sergeant Brimmer, on his return, that you are
released from further duty here. You will report
at my office at half-past two this afternoon
for your instructions. That is all. Sergeant,
follow me to the next squad room."</p>

<p>The instant that the door closed Hal and Noll
began to execute a swift little dance of joy, while
the other rookies looked on in grinning congratulation.</p>

<p>"What sort of regiment is the Thirty-fourth,
Sergeant?" asked Hal, after he and Noll had
reported to Sergeant Brimmer.</p>

<p>"Just like any other infantry regiment," replied
Sergeant Brimmer. "They're all alike.
The only difference is in the station, and the
station of each infantry command is usually
changed every two or three years. For that
matter, though you join in the Rockies, your
regiment, two months later, may be ordered to
the Philippines."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon Hal and Noll reported at the
post adjutant's office. Here they were provided
with their railway tickets through to their new
station, and were handed each a sum of money
in place of rations. In addition they were
granted four days' furlough before starting,
this furlough to be spent at their homes. Then,
each carrying his canvas case containing his surplus
outfit, the young recruits started down to
the dock to take the three-thirty boat to New
York City.</p>

<p>What a glorious furlough it was, while it
lasted! All their old schoolmates in the home
town, and all the smaller youngsters, listened
to the tales Hal and Noll told of the Army.
Two or three dozen youngsters then and there
formed their resolutions to enlist in the Army
as soon as they were old enough.</p>

<p>Tip Branders had left town. Where Tip had
gone was not known&mdash;but Uncle Sam's two
young recruits were destined to find out later
on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>A SWIFT CALL TO DUTY</h3>


<div class='cap'>"SEE that man in the black derby and the
brown suit, coming this way, Noll?
The one with the iron-gray hair?"</div>

<p>"Of course," replied Noll.</p>

<p>"Salute him, if we get close enough."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He's an officer."</p>

<p>"Maybe," half-assented Noll, eyeing the man
with iron-gray hair.</p>

<p>"There isn't much doubt about it," retorted
Hal. "He boarded the train at Kansas City.
It's summer, but he's going somewhere up in
the hills, for he had an overcoat over one arm
when he boarded the train, and that overcoat
was an officer's coat. He's in the service, and
he isn't any junior officer, either, judging by
the color of his hair."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh! Be ready with your salute."</p>

<p>The two young recruits, their uniforms looking
spick and span, despite their long journey
by train, now brought their right hands smartly
up to their cap visors as the man with iron-gray
hair stepped close.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave Hal and Noll a prompt, smart
acknowledgment of their salute, then suddenly
paused, glanced at them, and asked:</p>

<p>"My men, how did you know me to be an officer?"</p>

<p>"I observed your overcoat, sir, when you
boarded the train at Kansas City," Hal answered.</p>

<p>"You judged rightly, men," replied the officer,
with a smile. "I am Major Davis, Seventeenth
Cavalry. And you, as I see by your caps,
belong to the Thirty-fourth Infantry."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal answered. "We are joining
the first battalion at Fort Clowdry."</p>

<p>"Recruits?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I wish you a pleasant life in the Army,
men."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; we feel certain of finding
it," Hal replied.</p>

<p>Both young soldiers saluted, again, as the
major turned to resume his walk.</p>

<p>The train had stopped at Pueblo, Colorado,
in the middle of the afternoon. It would be but
half an hour's delay. Noll had been eager to
step out away from the railway station and see
as much of Pueblo as was possible. Hal had
negatived this idea, through fear that they
might be left behind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"And we've not an hour to spare, you know,
Noll. This is the last train for us to take if
we're to report in season. So we'd better stay
close to the conductor."</p>

<p>During the forenoon the train had rolled
across the mesa or tableland below Pueblo.
Hal and Noll, seated in one of the two day
coaches of the train, had studied the mesa with
longing eyes. Here they caught occasional
glimpses of cowboys on ponies, for this mesa is
still a favorite cattle region.</p>

<p>At this height of some five thousand feet
above sea level even the late June day was not
really hot. It was a glorious country on which
the young recruits feasted their eyes.</p>

<p>"Where do we eat next?" asked Noll, of a
trainman standing by.</p>

<p>"Any time and place you like, if you've got
the chow with you," replied the trainman.</p>

<p>"What is the next eating station at which the
train stops?" Noll insisted.</p>

<p>"Salida. We ought to stop there about nine
o'clock to-night."</p>

<p>"Good eating place?"</p>

<p>"Great."</p>

<p>"It's a long time to wait," complained Noll,
whom the mountain air was making furiously
hungry. "Come along, Hal. We'll lay in a
few sandwiches as a safety-valve."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope they're not as bad as some we've
bought along the way," Hal laughed, as they
started toward the railroad restaurant. "Do
you remember the sandwich we bought at
Chicago that had the stamp on the under side,
'U. S. Army, 1863?'"</p>

<p>"No, and neither do you," grinned Noll.</p>

<p>"Fact," insisted Hal. "I found the stamp
on the sandwich, and threw it out of the car.
I'm sorry, now; I wish I had saved that sandwich
for a curiosity. Father would have been
proud of it."</p>

<p>Noll with a bag of sandwiches, Hal with a box
of fruit, the two recruits turned toward the
train again.</p>

<p>They were soon under way. After leaving
Pueblo they forgot all about eating, for some
time, for the train now bore them through some
of the most picturesque parts of the lower
Rocky Mountains. Both rookies spent their
time on one of the car platforms, hanging far
out at either side to get better views, as well as
glimpses down steep cliffs into gullies below.</p>

<p>"Say, it's going to be dark, soon," remarked
Noll, looking toward the western sky. "Why on
earth didn't we get a train that would do the
whole trip between Pueblo and Salida in daylight?"</p>

<p>"Because we didn't know the route well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
enough," sighed Hal. "However, we may
think we've had plenty of Rocky Mountains
before our regiment's station is changed."</p>

<p>Half <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and'">an</ins> hour later both went back to their
seat in the car. Black night had come on and
shut out all further possibility of viewing the
wonderful country through which the train was
passing.</p>

<p>"We can eat, anyway," sighed Noll.</p>

<p>For the next fifteen minutes they regaled
themselves, though they were careful not to eat
enough to spoil their appetite for a good hot
supper at Salida.</p>

<p>Then, as peering out of the window revealed
nothing, Noll settled back in the seat.</p>

<p>"If I go to sleep, be sure to wake me at Salida,"
he begged. "What time is the train due
at Fort Clowdry?"</p>

<p>"Two o'clock in the morning," Hal answered.</p>

<p>"That's a beastly time to have to be awake,"
growled Noll, and began to slumber.</p>

<p>Not for long, however. On a steep up-grade
the train was barely crawling along.</p>

<p>Suddenly it stopped, and with a considerable
jolt, too.</p>

<p>Bang, bang, bang! The whistle of bullets was
heard alongside the train, wherever windows
were open.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Noll, jumping up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>But Hal was in the aisle before him. Both
hastened to the rear door.</p>

<p>"Here, laddy-bucks," called a brakeman
grimly, "stay inside! It's healthier!"</p>

<p>"What's up?" demanded Hal, without pausing.</p>

<p>"Judging by the sound, the train is held up,
laddy-buck. It's a bad business going outside
if that's the case."</p>

<p>But at this instant the door was opened before
Hal's face. Major Davis bounded into the
car.</p>

<p>"Come with me, men," he called sharply.
"You're not armed, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Even at that exciting moment Hal did not
forget his salute.</p>

<p>"Then keep behind me," ordered the major,
drawing his revolver. "This is a mail train,
and, as a United States officer, I can't allow an
attempt to rob it pass without an attempt at a
protest."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>GUARDING THE MAIL TRAIN</h3>


<div class='cap'>MAJOR DAVIS backed quickly out of
the car, holding his weapon behind his
back as he dropped to the ground beside
the car.</div>

<p>He did not look to see whether the rookies
were behind him, but they were.</p>

<p>Ahead, and about them, all was black, save
for the light that came through the car windows.</p>

<p>In a twinkling, out of the fringe of darkness,
almost beside the recruits, stepped a masked
man.</p>

<p>"Back, all three of you. Back into the car!"
called the masked man sharply.</p>

<p>Major Davis wheeled like a flash, bringing his
revolver to bear. But he could not use it. A
sudden move of the recruits prevented.</p>

<p>"Noll!" called Hal sharply, and threw himself
to the ground before the masked ruffian.</p>

<p>Like a flash Hal wrapped his arms around the
knees of the masked robber. In almost the same
instant Hal struggled to his feet, carrying the
unknown's legs up with him.</p>

<p>Of course the ruffian toppled over backward.
But Noll, who had darted to his chum's aid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
hurled himself upon the fellow, striking him
hard three times between the eyes.</p>

<p>The masked man's revolver was discharged as
he toppled over backward, but the bullet sped
harmlessly off into the night.</p>

<p>In another second Hal had the fellow's revolver.</p>

<p>"Fix him, Noll!" called Private Overton,
darting forward to the officer's side.</p>

<p>"I have, already," muttered Noll. But he
bent for an instant over the unconscious ruffian's
body, then darted forward.</p>

<p>"Here's his box of cartridges, Hal," panted
Noll.</p>

<p>All this had seemed to occupy but a few seconds.</p>

<p>"Splendidly done!" glowed Major Davis.
"Now come forward, and support me."</p>

<p>At the moment of the discharge of the pistol
the uncoupled engine started forward, away
from the train, with a hissing of steam. This
noise must have drowned out the noise of the
single shot from the train robbers up forward.</p>

<p>Suddenly Major Davis shot out his left arm,
and Hal, bumping against it, halted beside the
officer.</p>

<p>"There are two of the men, standing by the
mail car," whispered the major. "Raise your
revolver. Ready! Fire!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 293px;">
<img src="images/illus130.png" width="293" height="450" alt="&quot;Back, All Three of You!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Back, All Three of You!&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Both the major's revolver and Hal's spat out
jets of flame. Both poured their shots in rapidly
at the two men whom they could just make
out in the darkness ahead.</p>

<p>Then Hal had a sudden, new sensation, not
by any means agreeable.</p>

<p>The two men, neither hit so far, turned and
raised their own weapons. It seemed like two
bright cascades of flame just ahead, as the
ruffians fired, kneeling.</p>

<p>Bullets whistled close to the major and the
two recruits on either side.</p>

<p>Then, just as suddenly, one of the ruffians
toppled over; it was impossible to tell whether
Major Davis or Hal Overton had scored the
hit.</p>

<p>Thereupon, the other man, lowering his
weapon, leaped for the steps of the mail car and
vanished.</p>

<p>Major Davis ran forward, followed by both
recruits. Noll was intent on getting a revolver
for himself.</p>

<p>But Davis, more accustomed to the ways of
fighting men, suddenly crouched low, peering
under the body of the car just behind the mail
coach.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the major began to fire
again, in answer to shots that came from underneath
the car.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>But Noll waited for nothing. His sole
thought was to possess a weapon. He halted
over the fallen one, snatched an empty revolver
from his side, then saw that the man was
wounded in the right breast.</p>

<p>"You must have some cartridges," muttered
Noll, rummaging in the fellow's clothes.</p>

<p>He found the box just in time.</p>

<p>"Lie down, you two!" called Major Davis
sharply to Hal and Noll. "You'll be fired on
from ahead."</p>

<p>Hal threw himself flat, and none too soon, for
now a gust of bullets swept down from the head
of the train.</p>

<p>As coolly as he could Hal Overton reloaded.
Noll, also lying flat on the ground, was similarly
engaged.</p>

<p>Hal was ready to fire first. There was need
of it, too, for he could dimly make out two men,
near the extreme head of the train, who were
firing rapidly and firing their weapons in a
fashion that drove up spurts of dirt all about
the recruits.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the fight seemed as serious
to those engaged in it as battle on a larger scale
could have been.</p>

<p>Major Davis now made the first direct move.
He crawled swiftly under the car, putting himself
on the same side with the man he was after.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>There was more shooting on the other side of
the train; then, suddenly it stopped.</p>

<p>The two ahead, who were engaging Hal and
Noll, dodged off to the side of the track into the
darkness. Now, all firing stopped, for all
weapons were empty.</p>

<p>"I hope that other scoundrel didn't get the
major!" throbbed Hal anxiously.</p>

<p>Yet he couldn't go to see. He had his own
work on this side of the train.</p>

<p>"Where are our pair?" whispered Noll,
creeping closer.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Hal answered, also in a whisper.
"But crawl off a little way. Bunching
together gives 'em a better mark to hit."</p>

<p>Lying flat on the ground, both recruits played
the waiting game.</p>

<p>Had the pair ahead stolen off altogether in the
darkness?</p>

<p>"I'll wait a few moments," Hal decided.
"Then, if I don't hear from the scoundrels, I'll
cross over to see what has happened to Major
Davis."</p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack! The vanished pair of
train robbers were opening fire again, from behind
a boulder that sheltered them admirably.
Hal and Noll had no protection other than they
could get from lying close to the ground. But
they answered the fire briskly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack! As fast as revolvers
were emptied the marksmen reloaded and again
began firing. In daylight the execution would
have been swifter, but all hits made in black
darkness are made by the grace of luck.</p>

<p>In the first place the only target anyone in
the combat had was the flash of an opponent's
pistol.</p>

<p>The train robbers behind the ledge changed
their positions after nearly every shot. And
Hal and Noll, after the warm, uncomfortable
experience of having bullets fan their faces persistently,
found it advisable to crouch low and
dart here and there, firing from new positions.</p>

<p>All this time the scores of people on the train
were sitting in terrified silence. Passengers or
train crews rarely interfere in a case of this
kind.</p>

<p>Not even the train's lights aided either side,
for the two young recruits had taken pains to
close in on the ledge sufficiently to escape illumination
by the train's lights.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack! This was a new note,
coming from past the forward end of the ledge.</p>

<p>Almost in the same instant a howl sounded
from behind the barrier of rock.</p>

<p>Then another voice was heard, shouting.</p>

<p>"Hold on! We surrender! Stop the shooting!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly this hail was answered by another.
It sounded good to the young recruits as Major
Davis roared from behind the forward end of
the ledge:</p>

<p>"Then throw up your hands, keep them up,
and walk into the train light where we can see
you."</p>

<p>"You won't shoot?" demanded the voice of
the surrendering one.</p>

<p>"Not unless you attempt tricks," replied the
voice of Major Davis.</p>

<p>"All right. Here I come."</p>

<p>A lone figure rose over the edge of the ledge,
and a tall, masked man, holding his hands very
high, strode toward the train, passing between
Hal and Noll, who instantly turned and covered
him with their weapons.</p>

<p>"Where's the other man?" demanded Major
Davis, still invisible in the blackness beyond.</p>

<p>"You'll find him behind the ledge," returned
the surrendered one. "He's hurt too bad to
move."</p>

<p>"Overton," called the major, "keep your
weapon trained right on that prisoner. Terry,
join me behind the ledge."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered both recruits.</p>

<p>Noll was quickly with the major on the further
side of the ledge. Here they speedily found a
masked man, short and rather thick-set, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the appearance of being unconscious. He was
breathing with great effort, a deep crimson spot
appearing on his right breast.</p>

<p>"May I ask, sir, about the man you went
under the train to get?" queried Noll.</p>

<p>"He's dead, my man," replied Major Davis
very quietly.</p>

<p>"Shall I try to lift this man, sir?"</p>

<p>"No; take his revolver, and search him for
other weapons, as far as you can do so without
disturbing the fellow and putting him in more
pain. We'll let that hiding train crew move the
casualties to the baggage car."</p>

<p>So Noll completed his search, while the conductor,
baggage-master and some of the brakemen,
noting that the firing had stopped, ventured
forth.</p>

<p>"You trainmen take care of the dead and
wounded," directed Major Davis crisply.
"Terry, rejoin your comrade. I shall have to
trouble you two men to stand guard over the
prisoners in the baggage car until we reach
Salida."</p>

<p>Both recruits saluted. Noll returned to the
track in time to find that the first man whom
he and Hal had bowled over was just coming
back to his senses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE ROOKIES REACH FORT CLOWDRY</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONCE more the train was under way.
The engineer had taken his uncoupled
engine some distance up the track, but
had returned when sent for, and now the train,
twenty additional minutes late, was crawling up
the steep grade.</div>

<p>The wounded men lay on the floor of the car,
receiving the attentions of a physician who had
been found among the passengers.</p>

<p>The unwounded ones stood in a corner at
the forward end of the car, Private Hal Overton,
revolver in hand, watching the men closely.</p>

<p>Noll, a revolver in either hand, stood a little
past the middle of the car, looking wholly businesslike.</p>

<p>Major Davis, having gone back to make sure
that his own belongings were safe, now returned
to the baggage car.</p>

<p>"Fellow," he asked of the tall prisoner,
"what on earth made you stop this train?"</p>

<p>"Hard up," replied the man sullenly. "And
a friend told us that the last time he held up
a mail train, he and his pal found twelve thousand
dollars in the registered mail pouches."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll find at least twelve years in the mail
pouches this trip," retorted Major Davis
grimly.</p>

<p>Half an hour later a stop was made at a little
tank station, to enable Major Davis to wire
ahead to Salida for officers to be in readiness
when they arrived.</p>

<p>Then the train crawled on again through the
inky darkness. Noll relieved Hal, presently,
though there seemed little need of alertness.
The two prisoners capable of fighting looked
pretty well cowed. Down at the rear end of the
car, covered with a rubber blanket, lay the rigid
remains of the man killed by the major.</p>

<p>Something more than an hour late the train
pulled in at Salida. There was a crowd on hand,
including four sheriff's officers. These latter
came to the baggage car just before the train
stopped.</p>

<p>"Will you take full responsibility for the prisoners
now?" asked Major Davis of one officer
who led the rest and who displayed his badge.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go and have something to eat,"
smiled the major dryly. "My men, do you eat
here, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal answered, saluting.</p>

<p>It was not an invitation to join their officer.
Both recruits fully understood that. The gulf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of discipline prevents officers and men eating together.</p>

<p>On the platform before the station-building
Major Davis halted long enough to say:</p>

<p>"My men, I appreciate your help to-night. It
would have been too much for me alone. You
men stood by me like soldiers. As a United
States Army officer I would have felt disgraced
had I allowed a United States mail car to be
rifled without striking a blow to stop it."</p>

<p>"It was a daring thing to do, sir," Hal ventured,
with another salute.</p>

<p>"It was my plainest sort of duty, as an officer,"
replied Major Davis, returning the salute.</p>

<p>"May I ask, sir," ventured Hal, "whether it
would have been our duty, had we been armed,
and you not on the train?"</p>

<p>"Not unless led by an officer," replied the
major. "But where did you young men learn
to obey so promptly, and without questioning
or hesitation?"</p>

<p>"At the recruit rendezvous, sir."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"At Bedloe's Island, sir."</p>

<p>"Who was your instructor?"</p>

<p>"One of them, sir, was a namesake of yours&mdash;Corporal
Davis."</p>

<p>"He will be glad to hear of this," nodded the
major, smiling. "Corporal Davis is my son."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your son, sir&mdash;an enlisted man?" stammered
Hal.</p>

<p>"Yes. My son enlisted in order to try to win
a commission. Thank you, men, and good-night.
I will tell the sheriff's men that you will be
found at Fort Clowdry if you are wanted as
witnesses."</p>

<p>Again acknowledging their salutes, Major
Davis stepped inside.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll waited a moment before entering
the station. When they did so, and passed
on to the lunch room, they saw Major Davis at
a table in one corner, so the rookies passed on
to stools before the lunch counter.</p>

<p>"How long have we to eat?" asked Hal, of
one of the trainmen.</p>

<p>"You've about twenty-two minutes left."</p>

<p>"I feel as if I could make excellent use of all
the time," laughed Hal.</p>

<p>He and Noll plunged into hot chicken, potatoes
and gravy, and plenty of side dishes. The
late excitement had not destroyed the appetite
of either recruit.</p>

<p>When they had finished Hal asked the waiter:</p>

<p>"How much do we owe you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the waiter. "I was told
to say that the account is settled, with Major
Davis's compliments."</p>

<p>Both recruits turned, saluting in the major's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
direction, as token of their thanks. He nodded,
smiling.</p>

<p>Out on the platform, just before the train
started, the recruits saw Major Davis again.
That officer was turned halfway from them,
without seeing them, so they passed along to the
day coach in which they had been riding.</p>

<p>Now a dozen men crowded about them, eager
to talk with the young heroes of the night.</p>

<p>"Pretty gritty work that you boys did,"
grinned one of the men. "Do you often have
things like that to do in the Army?"</p>

<p>"We never did, before to-night," Hal answered
quietly.</p>

<p>"Must take a lot of nerve."</p>

<p>"We didn't think of it at the time," smiled
Hal. "It seemed all in the way of business."</p>

<p>"You ought to have seen the folks you left
behind here," put in another man.</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up," called others.</p>

<p>"No, I won't," retorted the last speaker.
"What do you suppose we folks that you left
behind in this car were doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very noisy, was it?" queried Hal.</p>

<p>"Not particularly," admitted the man, with a
laugh. "We were lying along the aisle, or else
we crawled under seats. At one time there were
altogether too many bullets hitting the side of
the car, or coming through the windows. None<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of us in here got hit, but that was because of the
good care we took of ourselves."</p>

<p>"Oh, we might have done something," protested
another man, "only we didn't have anything
to shoot with."</p>

<p>"These two young soldiers didn't have anything
to shoot with, either, at the outset of the
trouble. They hustled outside and got their
guns from the enemy."</p>

<p>"Got any of those guns now?" asked another
passenger, crowding forward. "Want to sell
any of 'em?"</p>

<p>"We haven't even a cartridge," Hal replied.</p>

<p>"What did you do with them?"</p>

<p>"Turned them over to the sheriff's officers,
of course."</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour before the curious passengers
would consent to leave the young soldiers
to themselves. Noll finally managed to
convey an excellent hint by leaning back in his
seat and closing his eyes as if in sleep.</p>

<p>Hal dozed somewhat, but by one o'clock in the
morning both recruits were wide awake.</p>

<p>"What time are we due at Clowdry?" Hal
asked the passing brakeman.</p>

<p>"More'n an hour late," answered the trainman.</p>

<p>"Whew! That means we won't get there
until after three in the morning," muttered Hal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish we wouldn't get there until daylight,"
rejoined Noll. "Then I'd feel like dropping
back for another nap."</p>

<p>Nearly everyone else in the car was dozing,
it being after midnight.</p>

<p>It was half-past three o'clock in the morning
when the brakeman rested his hand on Hal's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"We ought to be at Clowdry in five minutes
now," said the brakeman.</p>

<p>"Much obliged," Overton answered. "Thank
goodness, Noll."</p>

<p>By the time that the train slowed up both recruits
were out on the rear platform of the car,
each gripping his canvas case.</p>

<p>"Clowdry! Clowdry!" bawled the brakeman.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll dropped off into the black night.
The only light was in the station, past which
the train slowly rolled.</p>

<p>There was no one in the station save the telegraph
operator. On these mountain divisions,
where accidents may so easily happen, a night
operator is kept at every station.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll stood on the station platform
until the train had pulled out. Then, as their
eyes became more accustomed to the darkness,
they made out what appeared to be a small hotel
on the other side of the track. There were two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
or three other buildings near by that looked like
dwellings.</p>

<p>"Clowdry is a pretty large city," observed
Noll, with a grin.</p>

<p>The real town was nearly a mile away.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the fort is," returned Hal.
"We'll ask the operator."</p>

<p>Apparently the operator was too well accustomed
to seeing soldiers to take any deep interest
in this new pair. But he was obliging, at
any rate.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," he called back, in answer
to Private Overton's question, "and I'll go and
show you the road."</p>

<p>So the two soldiers stood by their canvas cases
until the operator had finished at his clicking
instruments. Then the operator came out,
heading for the rear door of the station.</p>

<p>"I'll show you from here, Jack," called the
operator. "You see that road? Follow it
about a half a mile; take the first turn to the
left, and then keep straight on until you come
to the fort."</p>

<p>"How far is Fort Clowdry?" Hal wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"About three miles from here."</p>

<p>"Good road?" questioned Noll.</p>

<p>"Tenderfeet, ain't you?" asked the operator,
smiling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Hal.</p>

<p>"Thought you must be," nodded the operator,
"else you'd know that the road between an
Army post and the nearest freight station is always
a good one. Them Army wagon bosses
would put up a fearful holler if they had to drive
the transport wagons over bad roads. Just
joining?"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Hal.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you! Well, follow the road and
you can't have any trouble."</p>

<p>"Thank you, and good-night," came from
both recruits. Then, each taking a new grip on
his canvas case, which was fairly heavy, the recruits
started down the road.</p>

<p>They came, finally, to the turn to the left.</p>

<p>"These equipment cases don't grow any
lighter with distance, do they?" laughed Hal.</p>

<p>"Mine doesn't," grunted Noll.</p>

<p>When they had walked on a good deal farther
Noll remarked:</p>

<p>"I wish we had that operator here!"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"He told us it was three miles. We could
ask him what kind of miles."</p>

<p>"There's daylight coming," nodded Hal,
pointing to the east. "That will make the distance
seem shorter."</p>

<p>The sun up, at last, gave the recruits their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
first glimpse of their first station in the Army.
Fort Clowdry lay before them. There were no
frowning parapets, no stone battlements, no
cannon in sight. Fort Clowdry, as seen at the
distance, consisted of a great number of buildings,
of all sizes.</p>

<p>Boom! went a gun suddenly.</p>

<p>"Great!" cried Hal, his eyes shining.
"That's the essence of the soldier's life&mdash;the
sunrise gun. The Flag has just been hauled
up."</p>

<p>In the middle distance the recruits caught
sight of a soldier pacing, his gun, with bayonet
fixed, at shoulder arms.</p>

<p>"That sentry will put us on the rest of our
way," predicted Noll.</p>

<p>It being now broad daylight the sentry did
not challenge the newcomers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>"TWO NEW GENERALS AMONG US"</h3>


<div class='cap'>"SENTRY, we're recruit privates, joining
the regiment at this station," announced
Hal. "Where do we report?"</div>

<p>Bringing his rifle to port arms the soldier replied:
"This is post number seven. You'll find
post number one at that building under the fir-tree.
That's the guard-house. Report, first,
to the corporal of the guard."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sentry."</p>

<p>"Welcome."</p>

<p>Bringing his piece to shoulder arms, the sentry
resumed his pacing.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll now followed a well-kept road
to the guard-house. Outside stood the corporal
of the guard for this relief. As he gazed at the
young soldiers, noting their canvas cases, he did
not need to be told that they were recruits.
None but recruits have cases the pattern they
were carrying.</p>

<p>"Corporal," reported Hal, "we are Privates
Overton and Terry, under orders to join the
Thirty-fourth."</p>

<p>"Take seats inside, then," said the corporal.
"Go to sleep in your chairs, if you want to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Several other privates, belonging to the
guard, were dozing in chairs. But Hal and Noll
felt now too wide awake to think of dozing.
They longed to step outside for a better look
at this post, which was to be their future home.
Yet, having been directed to remain inside, they
obeyed.</p>

<p>It was a long while afterward before a bugler
blew the first call to reveille, which is the "Army
alarm clock," the signal to rise.</p>

<p>"Attention!" called the corporal, a few minutes
afterward.</p>

<p>All the dozers sprang to their feet, standing at
attention.</p>

<p>The officer of the day entered, looking over the
men.</p>

<p>Then his glance fell upon the recruits.</p>

<p>"You are new men joining?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal and Noll answered, presenting
their orders.</p>

<p>"Corporal, when mess call sounds send a private
of the guard with these men to put them in
D Company's mess for their first meal."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry, you will report at the
adjutant's office promptly at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>The officer remained to glance over the guard
report, then went away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"When does that mess call sound, Corporal?"
asked Hal.</p>

<p>"Five minutes more. Bates, you'll take the
recruits to D Company's mess."</p>

<p>Nor did either recruit feel sorry when he was
ushered into the enlisted men's mess, near barracks.</p>

<p>"Attention!" roared one waggish soldier.</p>

<p>As by instinct the men in the room stood at
attention.</p>

<p>"Two new young generals are honoring us
this morning," grinned the wag.</p>

<p>"Throw him out!" growled a sergeant. "It's
bad enough to be a rookie without having it
rubbed in."</p>

<p>The first sergeant now gave the seating order,
and the men fell in at table. The wag sat
at Noll's left.</p>

<p>"I find I'm mistaken," called the wag, down
the table. "Our guests are only colonels."</p>

<p>"You'll be a general, one of these days, if
you don't look out, Fowler," warned another
soldier near by.</p>

<p>"The gypsies always told my mother I'd be
a general," replied Fowler complacently.</p>

<p>"Yes, a general prisoner," continued the soldier
who had just warned the wag.</p>

<p>This raised a prompt laugh, for, in the Army,
a "general prisoner" is one who is serving a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
term of confinement after sentence by a general
court-martial.</p>

<p>"There are generals, and generals, of course,"
admitted Fowler.</p>

<p>"There'd be a general famine, Fowler, if you
ever stopped talking at mess long enough to do
all the eating that your mouth calls for."</p>

<p>"How long have you young gentlemen been
out of West Point?" asked Fowler, turning to
Noll.</p>

<p>Noll grinned, but did not make any answer to
this question.</p>

<p>"I hope you are West Pointers," continued
the company wag. "Nearly all of the gentlemen
present are West Pointers."</p>

<p>"Give the rooks time to eat their meal in comfort,"
ordered a sergeant gruffly. "Have you
forgotten the day, Fowler, when you were the
greenest rook that the Thirty-fourth ever had?"</p>

<p>"I never was a rook," retorted Fowler.</p>

<p>"You never got beyond being one," retorted
a corporal. "Don't mind this chin-bugler,
lads. He doesn't know any better."</p>

<p>Hal was paying attention strictly to the meal
before him. A good-sized piece of steak and a
dish of baked potatoes had come his way, and
he enjoyed them keenly. The men of this battalion
had a first class commissary officer and
lived well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've visiting cards with you, of course?"
continued Fowler, after a few moments.</p>

<p>"No," Noll admitted.</p>

<p>"Why, rook, you'll need cards. You've got
to call on the K. O. (commanding officer) after
breakfast. But we'll fix you out. I'll lend you
my pack. The jack of clubs is the one you want
to send in to the K. O. Then he'll know 'tis a
husky lad that has honored the Thirty-fourth
by joining."</p>

<p>"You'll live most of the time at the guard-house,
if you take Fowler for your authority on
doughboy life," broke in a quiet soldier across
the table.</p>

<p>"More likely the happy house would be our
address," laughed Hal.</p>

<p>"Doughboy" is the term applied to an infantry
soldier. Hal and Noll, being in an infantry
regiment, had thereby become doughboys.
The "happy house" is the part of a military hospital
where mild cases of insanity are confined.</p>

<p>The meal was soon over, and the first sergeant
took the trouble to go up to the boys.</p>

<p>"When do you report at the adjutant's
office?" he asked.</p>

<p>"At nine o'clock, Sergeant," Hal responded.</p>

<p>"Then, as long as you don't bother anyone
else, you can just as well stroll where you please
around the post, until nine," continued the sergeant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
"Of course you know that nine o'clock
means nine to the very minute?"</p>

<p>"We were taught a lot about punctuality at
the rendezvous station," Hal answered.</p>

<p>"Punctuality is about the greatest virtue in
Army life," nodded the first sergeant of D Company,
as he moved away.</p>

<p>In the interval of time at their disposal Hal
and Noll were able to see a good deal of Fort
Clowdry.</p>

<p>The center of the life there was the great
parade ground, a level, grassy plain.</p>

<p>At the north end of this plain stood a row
of pretty dwellings. The largest was the residence
of Colonel North, commanding officer of
the Thirty-fourth. Next to the colonel's residence
was that of Major Silsbee, the battalion
commander. Past the major's residence was a
row of somewhat smaller cottages, each the
home of a married officer. The name and rank
of each officer was on a doorplate. At the
furthest end of the row from Colonel North's
dwelling was a building containing quarters for
bachelor officers.</p>

<p>On another side of the parade ground were
various buildings devoted to the life of the post.
There was an Officers' Club, a library, a gymnasium,
and at one corner, the post hospital.</p>

<p>Further away from the parade ground were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the quarters of enlisted married men, and, beyond
that, the barracks of the four companies
of the Thirty-fourth stationed at Fort Clowdry.
Chapel also faced the parade ground, and, near
it, a Y. M. C. A. building.</p>

<p>Further away was the power house, for the
buildings and roads on the post were lighted by
electricity.</p>

<p>"Have we time to go over to the power
house?" asked Noll.</p>

<p>"We haven't," decided Hal, after consulting
his watch. "In twelve minutes we must be at
the adjutant's office."</p>

<p>"Here comes an officer," whispered Noll.</p>

<p>Both young soldiers were alert as a first lieutenant
came down the road toward them. At
the same instant Hal and Noll raised their right
hands smartly in salute, which was promptly returned
by that officer.</p>

<p>They had already inquired where the adjutant's
office was located. Having passed the
officer, our young recruits now hastened over to
the headquarters building.</p>

<p>"Adjutant's office?" inquired Hal of an orderly
before a door.</p>

<p>"Right inside," nodded the orderly.</p>

<p>Noll fell in behind Hal as the latter stepped
into the office. At a flat-top desk sat a battalion
sergeant-major, who is the non-commissioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
assistant of the regimental adjutant.
</p>

<p>At a roll-top desk in another corner of the
office the adjutant himself, a first lieutenant, was
seated.</p>

<p>"We are recruits reporting, Sergeant," announced
Hal, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"You have your orders with you?" asked the
sergeant-major.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant." Hal handed both sets of
papers to his questioner.</p>

<p>At the same time each recruit was alert to
salute the officer at the roll-top desk, in case he
should look up. But he didn't until the battalion
sergeant-major placed the papers on his
desk.</p>

<p>"Come here, men," directed the officer.</p>

<p>Both rookies stepped over to his desk, halted
and saluted.</p>

<p>"Recruit Privates Overton and Terry?"
asked the adjutant, after a glance at the papers.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The adjutant turned to examine a list that lay
on his desk.</p>

<p>"Private Overton to B Company. Private
Terry to C Company."</p>

<p>From an inner room stepped out a gray-haired
officer, wearing on his shoulder-straps the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
silver eagles of a colonel. This must be Colonel
North, the Thirty-fourth's K. O. Both recruits
immediately came to the salute again.</p>

<p>"These are the young men I wanted to see,
are they not, Wright?" asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"They are, sir," replied the adjutant, rising.</p>

<p>"Major Silsbee!" called the colonel, looking
over one shoulder.</p>

<p>That officer entered, also from the inner
room, and again the recruits saluted.</p>

<p>"Major," went on the colonel, "these are the
young men I told you about, who are joining
your battalion."</p>

<p>Major Silsbee looked them over keenly, even
if briefly.</p>

<p>"They look the part, Colonel," was the major's
comment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE SQUAD ROOM HAZING</h3>


<div class='cap'>"MEN, we have had word of you in advance
of your coming," continued
the colonel.</div>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Hal.</p>

<p>"Very good word, indeed. It seems that you
took stirring part in assisting an Army officer
last night."</p>

<p>"We obeyed Major Davis's orders, sir, if that
is what you refer to," Hal assented, once more
saluting.</p>

<p>"And did it in a manner that distinguishes
you as good soldiers, eh, major?" went on the
colonel, turning to Major Silsbee.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Major Silsbee. "Major
Davis's commendation is not earned except by
merit."</p>

<p>"You are surprised, I take it," resumed
Colonel North, bending a shrewd yet kindly
glance on the recruits, "that we should already
know of your conduct last night. Major Davis
wired me concerning it from Salida last night.
Men, this is a very good start, or, rather, a second
one, for your record, as forwarded me from
the recruit rendezvous, mentions that you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
already been commended in orders for aiding in
preventing the escape of a prisoner. You start
well, men, in the Thirty-fourth. Report to your
respective first sergeants that, with the approval
of your company commanders, you will not take
up with duty until to-morrow. That will give
you time to look about the post. If you wish,
you have also permission to be off post this
afternoon, for three hours beginning at two
o'clock. That is all."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," acknowledged each recruit,
saluting. Then they stepped forth.</p>

<p>"At the rate we're getting commended, we
ought soon to be brigadier generals," smiled
Hal.</p>

<p>"A second lieutenancy, even after four years,
will suit me well enough," retorted Noll. "But
what shall we do now?"</p>

<p>"Plainly enough our first duty is to report to
our first sergeants, as ordered."</p>

<p>"Too bad we couldn't be bunkies, in the same
company," murmured Noll.</p>

<p>"Yes; I would rather have had it that way.
But I take it that one of the first lessons a fellow
has to learn in the Army is that he can't
have things his own way."</p>

<p>"At all events we can be together during a
good deal of our leisure time," declared Noll.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;not even being half the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
apart&mdash;could prevent our being chums, old fellow."</p>

<p>Reaching barracks each recruit inquired
where to find his own first sergeant. Hal was
soon facing Sergeant Gray, of B Company.
The first sergeant of a company is a highly important
man. He is the ranking non-commissioned
officer of his company, and might aptly
be termed the "foreman" of the company. He
lives right with his company all the time, and
knows each man thoroughly. The first sergeant
is responsible to the company commander
for the discipline and order of the company.</p>

<p>"Is your name Overton?" asked Sergeant
Gray, holding out his hand. "Glad to have you
with us, Overton. You'll bunk in Sergeant
Hupner's squad room. Remember that, when
there's anything you really need to know, the
non-commissioned officers of the company are
paid to instruct you. Don't be afraid to ask
necessary questions."</p>

<p>"I won't, thank you, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"And don't be sensitive or foolish, Overton,
about any little pranks some of the men are more
or less bound to play upon you at first. The
easiest way to keep out of trouble is to be good-natured
all the time. But that doesn't mean
that you have to submit to any abuse."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sergeant."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, I'll take you to Sergeant Hupner."</p>

<p>That was more easily said than done. Sergeant
Gray took Hal to the squad room in which
he was to live thereafter, but Hupner was out
at the time.</p>

<p>"Just stay here a little while, and report to
Sergeant Hupner when he comes in," directed
the first sergeant. "He'll assign you to a bed
and make you feel at home."</p>

<p>Hardly had Sergeant Gray closed the door
when Hal thought he had taken the measure of
the eight other privates present. They looked
like a clean, capable and genial lot of young fellows.
He was speedily to find that they were
"genial" enough.</p>

<p>"So you want to be a regular, do you?"
quizzed one of the soldiers, halting before Hal,
and looking him over.</p>

<p>"Why, I am one already, am I not?" asked
Hal, smiling.</p>

<p>"No, sir, you're not," retorted the questioner.
"How did you start in? Made a grand stand
play on the train last night, didn't you? Helped
to shoot up a lot of train robbers, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"That was under orders of an Army officer,"
Hal replied good-naturedly. The other soldiers
had crowded about the pair.</p>

<p>"You went and played the hero, didn't you?"
persisted the questioner. "Probably you didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
know that a regular is never allowed to be a
hero. Heroes serve only in the volunteers."</p>

<p>This is a well-known joke in the Army. In
war time local pride in the volunteer regiments
is always strong. Local newspapers always devote
most of their war space to the "heroic"
doings of the local volunteer regiment. The
regulars do the bulk of the fighting, and the
most dangerous, but their deeds of daring are
rarely chronicled in the newspapers. All the
praise goes to the volunteer regiments. Hence,
in war time, a stock Army question is, "Are you
a hero or a regular?"</p>

<p>"I guess you've made a mistake," remonstrated
Hal, still good-naturedly. "My friend
and I didn't do anything in the heroic line. We
simply fired when told to, and stopped firing,
when told to. We didn't make any charges,
capture any forts, or do anything in the least
heroic. We simply stood by and did what the
major told us."</p>

<p>"Good," nodded one of the other men. "The
kid is bound to be a regular, all right. He
doesn't brag, and I don't believe he's looking for
any write-up in the newspapers."</p>

<p>"How did you feel under fire last night?"
continued the merciless questioner. "Brave as
a lion?"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it," laughed Hal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you cool under fire?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was!" Hal's answer leaped forth.
"Cool? Why, man, I was so cold that it took
me an hour, afterwards, to get warm again."</p>

<p>"He's got you there, Hyman," laughed another
soldier. "Oh, the kid's going to be one
of us, all right. He's no bouquet chaser."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," replied Private
Hyman gravely. "So many heroes in disguise
try to sneak in among the regulars that it pays
us to keep our eyes open. What sort of a medal
are you going to order from Congress, kid?"</p>

<p>"A leather one," smiled Hal, "though I'd
really prefer a tin medal."</p>

<p>Good-natured laughter greeted this answer.</p>

<p>But Private Hyman persisted:</p>

<p>"In war time you'd chuck us, just to get a
commission in the volunteers, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Not even for a general's commission in the
volunteers," retorted Hal.</p>

<p>"Are you good at athletics?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Know anything about gymnastics?"</p>

<p>"Only one or two things."</p>

<p>"Come down to the end of the room with
me," ordered Private Hyman.</p>

<p>Hal good-naturedly followed. So did the
others.</p>

<p>"Now, let's see if you can do this," Hyman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
proposed. "Take a good start and jump over
the first cot, then over the second, and right on
down the line, as far as you can do."</p>

<p>That didn't look difficult. Hal leaped over
the first cot, then, with hardly a pause, jumped
over the second. So on he went, down over the
line of ten cots.</p>

<p>"Now, go back again, over the cots on the
other side," ordered Private Hyman.</p>

<p>Hal did so without difficulty, though he was
flushed and panting by the time that he finished
this brisk exercise.</p>

<p>"Kid, you're no good," grunted Hyman.</p>

<p>"I didn't try to make you believe I was any
good," Hal retorted calmly.</p>

<p>"No, sir! Any man who jumps as easily and
naturally as you do would jump the regulars
any time, and go with the high-toned volunteer
crowd."</p>

<p>"Humph! A fellow who can jump like that
would jump right out of the service at the first
breath of trouble," broke in another soldier.</p>

<p>"He'd desert," agreed a third.</p>

<p>"Walk on your hands?" queried Hyman.</p>

<p>Hal proved that he could do so by throwing
his heels up into the air and taking a dozen steps
on his hands before he again came to an erect
attitude.</p>

<p>"Brains are all in your heels," remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Private Hyman thoughtfully. "Can you pick
that man up and carry him around on your
back?"</p>

<p>The soldier indicated weighed at least a hundred
and sixty pounds.</p>

<p>"I'll try," nodded Hal. Backing up to the
soldier, he locked elbows, back to back, lifted
the heavy one to his back and carried him twenty
feet down the squad room.</p>

<p>"Any fellow with all that strength in his back
would get his back up at trouble, and back out
of any fight that came his way," declared Private
Hyman. "But see here, can you place your
head on one chair and your feet on another,
stiffen your body and lie there without touching
the floor in any way."</p>

<p>"Let's see," proposed Hal. Two chairs were
quickly swung forward. Hal, who had good
muscular control, took the attitude named,
stiffened his body, and lay between the chairs
for some moments.</p>

<p>"He lies well and easily," observed one of
the onlookers.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Private Hyman. "He's easily
the champion liar of the company."</p>

<p>At that Hal sprang to his feet again.</p>

<p>As he did so he accidentally pushed one of
the chairs over backward. It was close to the
door, which, at that instant, opened. The flying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
chair struck the incomer across his shins, bringing
an angry exclamation from the man.</p>

<p>"Don't you know anything, rook?" demanded
the man, Private Bill Hooper. Hooper stood
five feet ten in his socks. He was just under
thirty, a man who was not popular in the company
because of his unruly temper.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," apologized Hal. "I didn't
know you were there."</p>

<p>"You'll be sorrier, now," cried Hooper
fiercely. Striding up to young Overton, Hooper
landed a sound box on one of the boy's ears.</p>

<p>Hal flushed crimson in an instant.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>PRIVATE BILL HOOPER LEARNS</h3>


<div class='cap'>"HOLD on, Hooper!"</div>

<p>"Don't act like a dog!"</p>

<p>"He's only a kid&mdash;can't you see?"</p>

<p>Then something happened like lightning.</p>

<p>Private Hal Overton had meant to take all his
hazing good-humoredly. But a blow struck in
anger, and without just cause, was more than he
was prepared to brook.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Gray told me I was not expected to
stand abuse," flashed through his mind.</p>

<p>So, instead of cringing away from a repetition
of the blow, Hal took a sudden bound forward.</p>

<p>Whack!</p>

<p>"I have no use for a box on the ear," smiled
Hal grimly. "So you can have it back!"</p>

<p>Private Bill Hooper let out a roar, then
sprang for the boy, intending to pulverize the
young rookie with his fists. But five or six of
the men sprang between them, forming an effective
human wall.</p>

<p>"Shame on you, Hooper!"</p>

<p>"That's no way for a man to act."</p>

<p>"Get off your blouse, kid," blustered Private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Hooper, as he unfastened his own blouse and
tossed it over the end of a cot. "You need a
trimming, and you're going to get it right
now!"</p>

<p>"Here, kid, button your blouse up again,"
ordered Private Hyman. "You ain't called
upon to fight that bully. Hooper, if you're
spoiling for fight I'll do my best to be kind to
you."</p>

<p>But Hal, the flush dying from his cheeks,
coolly continued unbuttoning his blouse. Then
he pulled it off, handing it to a soldier near by.</p>

<p>"Dress yourself, kid. You don't have to fight
a man twice your size."</p>

<p>"Let some one else have the job, kid. There's
some of us here will take it."</p>

<p>"The kid will stand up and take his own trimming,"
announced Hooper, with ugly emphasis.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!"</p>

<p>"Beat it, Hooper!"</p>

<p>"Mates," went on Hal, as soon as he could
make himself heard, "I'm willing to stand for
anything that's coming to a rook. But this is
a case that calls for something different. I've
got to satisfy this man that I can stand up before
a pair of fists, or he'll never respect me
enough to let me alone."</p>

<p>"Why, kid, a man of Hooper's size will reduce
you to powder," objected Hyman seriously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
"It's all right to have sand, and I guess
you've got it, but you've no call to be slaughtered."</p>

<p>"He'll thrash me," agreed Hal coolly, "but
I'll get in enough on him to make him want to
let me alone after this. I'm ready for the fellow."</p>

<p>Realizing that the rookie was in earnest the
soldiers stepped away from between the pair.</p>

<p>"But you play fair, Hooper, or we'll kick you
all over the squad room," warned another soldier.</p>

<p>Private Hooper clenched his fists, and stood
flexing his arms, which, through his shirt-sleeves,
appeared to be decidedly powerful.</p>

<p>"Step up, kid, and get your trimming," he
invited, with a ferocious smile.</p>

<p>"I don't know much about fighting," admitted
Hal, smiling pleasantly. "All I know my
dancing teacher taught me."</p>

<p>That raised a laugh and angered Hooper.
This was just what the rookie wanted to do, for
he judged that Hooper could be prodded into a
blind rage.</p>

<p>Hooper now jumped forward, aiming an ugly
swing for Hal's head. But the rookie side-stepped
swiftly out of the way. As he did so,
one foot dragged in front of the advancing
bully. Hooper tripped over that foot, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
force of his swing carried him forward so that
he fell flat on his face.</p>

<p>"Too bad! I hope you didn't hurt yourself,"
teased Hal sweetly, whirling about like a flash.</p>

<p>Hooper was up with an oath, wind-milling his
big arms.</p>

<p>"Take that!" he roared, aiming a heavy blow
straight at Hal's chest.</p>

<p>"Against the rules of my dancing master!"
mimicked Hal, bounding to the left. As he did
so he let his right fist drop on the point of Hooper's
chin.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted the bully.</p>

<p>"Spit it out, if it got in your mouth," advised
Hal unconcernedly, as he again faced his antagonist.</p>

<p>From the way he dodged the next six or eight
assaults it did look as though Hal had spoken
the truth when he stated that he had learned his
style of fighting from a dancing master. For
the nimble rookie never did seem to be just
where Bill Hooper looked for him when landing
blows.</p>

<p>"Take your partners!" mocked Hal Overton,
as he darted past again. This time, however,
he landed a very hot and powerful blow right
against Hooper's right eye.</p>

<p>Now cautious cries of approval went up from
the other men crowding about. All of the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
were careful not to make much noise, through
fear of bringing interference.</p>

<p>A minute later Hooper received such a stinging
blow on the nose that it brought a little
trickle of red.</p>

<p>"Woof!" panted Hal, in going by again.</p>

<p>"Woof!" echoed Hooper. "Wow&mdash;ow&mdash;ugh!"</p>

<p>Then he doubled up, winded, for Hal, after
feinting for the big fellow's face had calmly but
forcefully struck him just above the beltline.
Hooper was out of it for the present, and he
knew it.</p>

<p>"Now sail in and finish him, rook!" called
four or five men at once.</p>

<p>"Not this time," replied Hal, going over to
the soldier who held his blouse, taking the garment
and putting it on. "I'll save the rest for
the next dance whenever Hooper feels festive."</p>

<p>Grateful that he didn't have to stand and take
punishment in his present condition, Hooper
groped to a chair and sat down.</p>

<p>"Now, then, mates," announced Hal modestly,
"when we were interrupted I was trying to
show you that I don't ache to be a hero. Being
a regular is good enough for me. I am ready
to answer any further questions."</p>

<p>But just at that moment a bugle sounded the
call to drill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've answered enough questions for the
present, rook," replied Private Hyman, patting
Overton on the shoulder as he went by. Hooper
struggled into his blouse, then went over to a
sink and washed the red from his nose before
hurrying out with the others. The big private
didn't even look at Hal Overton as he went by.</p>

<p>Being excused from duty for the day, Hal
went in search of Noll Terry. He found him
waiting outside of barracks.</p>

<p>"Whew, but I've been through a mill," sighed
Noll.</p>

<p>"I've been ground just a bit myself," laughed
Hal.</p>

<p>"Did the fellows twit you about last night's
work?" asked Noll curiously.</p>

<p>"Well, some," admitted Hal.</p>

<p>"If there's anything left that the fellows in
the squad room can think of to do to me, I'm
wondering what it is," grunted Private Terry.</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll think up enough things," Hal
declared. "We needn't imagine that our mates
will exhaust themselves in twenty minutes of
fun. You didn't lose your temper, did you,
Noll?"</p>

<p>"No; and I don't want to. But there's one
fellow in our room that I am certain I'll have
to fight before I get through."</p>

<p>"There's a fellow in our room that I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
believe I will have to fight," chuckled Private
Overton.</p>

<p>"Have you been in a fight already?" asked
Noll, flashing a swift look at his chum.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Hal answered. "A dancing lesson
was as far as I got this morning. But come
along, Noll. I want to get where we can get a
look at the great mountains yonder. My, how
they seem to tower above the fort and wall us
in!"</p>

<p>Fort Clowdry was some fifty-two hundred
feet above sea level. From there, however,
high mountains were visible that extended some
thousands of feet higher in the air. All about
was a great view of rugged mountain scenery.</p>

<p>Over past the buildings at the west end of the
post the two rookies wandered. Now they had
a noble view of the mountains.</p>

<p>"Are you going off post this afternoon, as the
colonel said we could?" asked Noll, by and by.</p>

<p>"Not unless you very much want to, Noll.
Can't we put in the time better learning our way
around the post?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can," assented Noll.</p>

<p>A soldier came along, driving a pair of mules
to which a quarter master's wagon was hitched.
As he drew near, with a heavy load aboard, he
halted to rest the mules.</p>

<p>"Rooks, ain't ye?" questioned the soldier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Hal.</p>

<p>"Taking a survey of the post?"</p>

<p>"Rather. We don't have to report for duty
until to-morrow."</p>

<p>After a few moments the soldier climbed down
from the seat of the wagon. He was wholly
willing to tell the boys whatever they wanted
to know about Fort Clowdry and to point out
the features of interest in the surrounding lines
of mountains.</p>

<p>"Ever go hunting?" asked the soldier, at last.</p>

<p>"Yes; after squirrels and partridges,"
laughed Hal.</p>

<p>"No real hunting, though?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Then, if you can keep out of discipline troubles,
ye'll have some fun around here by and
by."</p>

<p>"Soldiers don't have much time for hunting,
do they?" Hal asked.</p>

<p>"Those that know how to hunt do," replied
the older soldier. "That's part of the life here.
Didn't ye ever hear about soldier hunting parties?"</p>

<p>"I certainly haven't," Hal admitted.</p>

<p>"Why, men of good conduct are often allowed
to go off on hunting parties when the game's
running right. Generally there's six or eight
men to a party, and all have to be fair shots, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the K. O. doesn't aim to have too much ammunition
wasted," explained the old soldier. "One
of the party is a non-com and he has charge of
the party."</p>

<p>"What do the hunters get?" queried Hal.</p>

<p>"Well, for bigger game, bear and mountain
antelope mostly. Then some parties go after
birds; there's plenty of them, too, in the mountains,
at the right seasons."</p>

<p>"Say!" exploded Noll, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>"Think ye'd like to go on a hunting party, do
ye?" asked the soldier. "Get up yer record for
marksmanship, then."</p>

<p>"What's done with the game?" asked Noll
innocently.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;&mdash;" the soldier started to repeat.
Then he added, dryly:</p>

<p>"Oh, we send the game to the hospitals in
Denver and Pueblo, of course!"</p>

<p>"Don't we get any of it to eat?" asked Noll,
looking up.</p>

<p>"Say, don't ever go off with a party that
doesn't bring back a big haul of game," advised
the older soldier. "If ye do, the company cooks
will lynch ye. Why, that's what we go hunting
for&mdash;to vary the bill of fare here at the post.
Sometimes, when we're all just aching for bear
steaks, an officer and twenty or thirty men all
hike off at once into the mountain trails. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
are plenty of game dinners at Clowdry, at different
times in the year."</p>

<p>Then the soldier climbed leisurely to the seat
of his wagon and started on again.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he was fooling us about hunting
parties," mused Hal.</p>

<p>Later on, however, the rookies discovered that
the soldier had told them the truth. On some of
the Western posts, hunting forms one of the diversions
of the men.</p>

<p>Presently they met another soldier, this time
afoot.</p>

<p>"How far can we go without getting off the
reservation?" Hal inquired.</p>

<p>"The way you're headed now you can go another
mile without getting off limits," the soldier
replied.</p>

<p>"Reservation" is a term applied to the limits
of an Army post. Wherever an Army post exists
it includes land reserved by the United
States from the jurisdiction of the individual
state. Hence the name of reservation.</p>

<p>It was wilder country out here, away from
the well-kept roads.</p>

<p>"Come on," urged Hal. "I'm going to take
a good walk yet."</p>

<p>They had gone along, briskly, for at least another
half mile when some flying missile went
by Hal's head. Noll, who was just behind him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
saw the missile, and watched it land on the
ground beyond.</p>

<p>"Whoever is throwing rocks of that size&mdash;quit!"
shouted Noll, wheeling to his left and
glaring at an irregularly-shaped ledge some
sixty yards away.</p>

<p>"Let's see who it is, anyway," cried Hal,
darting toward the ledge.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the ledge they heard
some lively scrambling among the rocks beyond,
but neither rookie could see anyone. All
was quiet for a few moments. Then a foot
slipped on a stone, at a little distance. Hal
raced straight in the direction of the sound.
He was in time to see a crouching, running
figure darting in and out among the rocks.</p>

<p>"Come on, Noll! We've got him!" yelled
Hal.</p>

<p>In another minute they had overtaken the fugitive,
who now stood panting at bay.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a nice one!" ejaculated Private
Hal Overton.</p>

<p>"Tip Branders&mdash;out here in Colorado!"
ejaculated Noll Terry.</p>

<p>"No; my name ain't Branders. Ye've got
me mixed up with somebody else!" glowered
the young man at bay.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERY OF POST THREE</h3>


<div class='cap'>"OH, no, your name isn't Tip Branders!"
mocked Hal Overton.</div>

<p>"That's what I said," retorted the
young man at bay.</p>

<p>"Then how do you know who we are?"</p>

<p>"I don't know who ye are, and what's more,
I don't care," retorted the other.</p>

<p>"Tip, I guess you've forgotten to write home
lately," broke in Noll. "What would you say
if you should hear that your uncle in Australia
had died and left your mother more than two
million dollars?"</p>

<p>The young man's eyes opened very wide indeed.
He gasped, and then his eyes flashed
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Has the old lady all that money?" he demanded.
"Noll Terry, what else do you know
about it?"</p>

<p>The young man came briskly forward now,
all trembling with eagerness.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything at all about it,"
retorted Noll coolly, "and I don't believe it
either."</p>

<p>"But you said&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Tip, what an idiot you are to think you
can deny your identity to us," jeered Noll, while
Hal laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Say, if you're trying to have sport with
me," snarled Tip, "I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it your idea of sport to shy rocks at us?"
demanded Private Hal.</p>

<p>"I didn't shy anything at you," asserted Tip
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Why, for that matter," Hal went on jeeringly,
"I don't suppose you'll even admit that
you're here, at all?"</p>

<p>"Don't get too festive, just because you've
got the government's blue clothes on," Tip retorted
sullenly. "A plain, ordinary soldier ain't
such a much."</p>

<p>"Opinions may differ about that, of course,"
Hal admitted. "But being a soldier was too
much of a job for you to get a chance at, wasn't
it, Tip?"</p>

<p>"I'm just as well suited as it is," rejoined
Tip, flushing a bit, none the less.</p>

<p>"You haven't told us what you're doing out
in this country," Noll suggested.</p>

<p>"And I don't know that it's any of your business,
either," Branders went on. "Ain't nothing
to be ashamed of, though. You know I
used to travel a bit with the political crowd at
home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"With the heelers of the city," Noll amended.</p>

<p>Tip scowled, but continued:</p>

<p>"Well, I got into a bit of a row, that's all.
So I lit out until things could blow over a bit."</p>

<p>"And took some of your mother's cash before
you left, I heard," nodded Private Noll
Terry.</p>

<p>"She gave it to me," cried Tip fiercely.
"Now, see here, don't you fellows say nothing
about seeing me out in this part of the country.
I'm out here trying to run down a good, new
start in life. You just keep your tongues behind
your teeth as far as my affairs are concerned."</p>

<p>"What kind of a new start can you make out
in these hills?" queried Hal.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm here to find out. My
cash has about run out, so I'm walking. I'm
bound for a ranch about forty miles west of
here, where I expect to land a job. So don't
you go to talking too much about me, and trying
to spoil me."</p>

<p>"Why did you try to knock me over with a
small-sized boulder?" Hal insisted.</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to play a joke on you,"
retorted Tip, with a grin.</p>

<p>"That's a lie, but let it go at that," rejoined
Hal Overton. "It would be too much, anyway,
wouldn't it, Tip, to expect the truth from you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"You always were down on me," replied
Branders half coaxingly. "If you'd only taken
more trouble to understand me you'd have
understood that I'm not a half bad fellow."</p>

<p>"No; only about nine-tenths bad," grimaced
Noll derisively.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no use in my staying here to
talk with you fellows," muttered Tip angrily.
"You never were friends of mine. So I'll be
on my way."</p>

<p>"Tramping it for forty miles, are you?"
called Noll, as Tip turned away.</p>

<p>"'Bout that," Branders called back over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Then, man alive, why don't you keep to the
road, instead of scrambling over these rough
boulders?"</p>

<p>Tip's only answer was a snort.</p>

<p>"Come back to the road," proposed Hal to
his chum. So the two rookies clambered back
over the ledge and down onto the excellent
military road. But they caught no further
glimpse of Tip Branders; plainly he preferred
different paths.</p>

<p>"What do you make out of Tip?" asked Noll,
a minute later.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Hal answered, "except that he
was lying, as usual, of course. Tip never tells
the truth; there's no sport in it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to know what he is doing out in this
country."</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon," suggested Hal, "that, as he
couldn't be a soldier, he thought he'd take up
cowboy life as the next best thing."</p>

<p>"He won't last long as a cowboy," laughed
Noll. "Tip hates work, and the cowboy is about
the hardest worked man in America."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't have to worry about Tip,"
muttered Hal. "We don't even have to talk
about him. Noll, look at those noble old mountains!"</p>

<p>"Some day, when we have enough time off,
we must walk to the mountains," urged Noll.
"I wonder how many miles away they are&mdash;five,
or six?"</p>

<p>"Hm!" laughed Hal. "I asked Sergeant
Gray, and he said that range over there is about
forty miles away."</p>

<p>"Forty!" Noll looked plainly unbelieving.</p>

<p>"You'll find out, Noll Terry, that the air in
these glorious old Rocky Mountains is so mighty
clear that you can't judge distances the way you
did back East. I'd rather have Sergeant
Gray's word than any evidence that my own
eyes can supply me with."</p>

<p>"We won't get to that mountain range, then,
until we have a week off," sighed Noll.</p>

<p>After wandering about for some time more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the young rookies strolled back to barracks.
Hal had yet to find Sergeant Hupner and get
assigned to a bed and a locker.</p>

<p>Hupner proved to be a rather short, but keen
and very pleasant fellow. He was of German
origin, but had no accent in his speech, having
been educated in this country.</p>

<p>"You'll like the regiment, the battalion and
B Company, Overton, when you get used to
us," Sergeant Hupner informed the young
rookie.</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it, Sergeant," Hal replied.
"But it'll be far more to the point, won't it, if I
make my comrades like me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll get along all right," replied
Hupner, who had had a report on the quiet of
Hal's performance with big Bill Hooper that
morning. "The main thing for a recruit,
Overton, is not to act as if he knew it all until
he really does. And no old soldier does claim
to know too much. You'll have to fall in for
dinner in about ten minutes. When the company
assembles report to Sergeant Gray, who'll
give you your place in the ranks."</p>

<p>When the two recruits marched into company
mess, that noon, both Hal and Noll felt odd.
The chums had not been used to being separated.</p>

<p>After dinner the two were together again,
however. Guided by Hyman they went to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
recreation hall, on the second floor of barracks
building. This hall was fitted up for games and
sports, and at one end was a stage with scenery.</p>

<p>"Who gives the shows?" asked Hal.</p>

<p>"Once in a great while the men chip in from
company funds to hire a real company, or
troupe," replied Private Hyman. "The officers
always add something, then. But, more often,
the men supply their own talent. We've got a
lot of show talent of all sorts among nearly four
hundred men."</p>

<p>Hyman was soon called away to a drill, though
not before he had pointed out other places of
interest. Hal and Noll went over to the library,
the gym. and the Y. M. C. A. building. They
wound up their afternoon of leisure by attending
parade just before retreat. Retreat is always
followed, immediately, by the firing of the
sunset gun and the hauling down of the post
Flag for the night.</p>

<p>When tattoo was sounded by the bugler that
night both chums were glad enough to turn
down their beds and get into them. Neither Hal
nor Noll remained awake more than two minutes.</p>

<p>The windows were open, and a cool, delicious
breeze, circulated through the squad room.
Hal slept the sleep of the truly tired, hearing
nothing of the martial snores of some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
men on adjoining cots. It was late in the night
when Private Overton was awakened by the
sound of a rifle shot.</p>

<p>"I must have been dreaming through the
scenes of last night again," Hal muttered
drowsily.</p>

<p>None of the other men in the room appeared
to have heard the sound at all.</p>

<p>But now it came again. A shot was followed
by a second, then by a third.</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard&mdash;post number three!"
yelled a lusty voice, though the distance was
such that Hal Overton heard the sound only
faintly.</p>

<p>Crack&mdash;crack!</p>

<p>Then a bugle pealed on the air, though still
Hal's comrades in the squad room slumbered
on.</p>

<p>Too curious to turn over and go to sleep
again, Hal stole softly from his cot and reached
an open window on the side that looked out over
the parade.</p>

<p>There was no moon, but in the light of the
stars Hal could see several uniformed men running
swiftly across the parade ground to officers'
row.</p>

<p>"It's no dream," muttered Overton, intensely
interested, "for there goes the corporal with
the guard. What on earth can it mean?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>There was something up&mdash;and something exciting,
at that, for experienced sentries never
fire except in case of need. Moreover, several
sentries&mdash;no fewer than four&mdash;had just fired
almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>Nor did the corporal and his squad return
within the next few minutes.</p>

<p>Whatever it was that had resulted in turning
out the guard, the need for the guard plainly
still continued.</p>

<p>"There's no more shooting, anyway," Hal reflected.
"I may as well go back to bed."</p>

<p>It was some minutes ere he could sleep. When
he did fall off it seemed as though only a minute
or two had passed when the bugle again
pealed.</p>

<p>Hal was on his feet in a second. So were
most of the other soldiers in the squad room
this time.</p>

<p>"Why, it's daylight now," uttered Hal, looking
astounded.</p>

<p>"Of course it is, rook," laughed the soldier
whose bed was next to Hal's. "That bugler
sounded first call to reveille. Don't you know
what that is yet?"</p>

<p>In other words the soldier's alarm clock had
"gone off." Though all of these men had
slept through the call for the corporal of the
guard, simply because it did not concern them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
every man had turned out at the first or second
note of "first call to reveille."</p>

<p>Every man dressed swiftly. As soon as he
got his clothing on each soldier turned up his
bedding according to the regulations.</p>

<p>There was some "policing" of the room done.
That is, everything was made shipshape and
tidy. Last of all, and within a very few minutes
from the start, the men made their way
briskly to the sinks, where soap and water, comb
and brush, put on the finishing touches. A sergeant,
two corporals and nearly a score of men
were now as neat and clean as soldiers must
ever be.</p>

<p>"What was that row in the night, Corporal?
Do you know?" Hal asked.</p>

<p>"What row in the night?" asked Corporal
Cotter.</p>

<p>"Why, there was a lot of shooting, and a call
for the corporal of the guard to post number
six."</p>

<p>"First I've heard of it," replied Corporal
Cotter. "But we'll know before long. Now,
step lively, rook, for you're on duty with the
rest to-day."</p>

<p>By the time that Sergeant Gray's squad room
emptied at the call of the bugle it was instantly
plain outside that something unusual was going
on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>A and D Companies, as they fell in, proved
each to be twenty men short.</p>

<p>"There are extra guards out, and a picket
down the road to town," muttered Private Hyman,
who stood next to Hal in the ranks.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked Hal Overton, but
instantly his thoughts went back to the shots and
the excitement of the night.</p>

<p>"Silence in the ranks," growled Corporal
Cotter.</p>

<p>But at breakfast tongues were unloosed. Hal
quickly told what little he had seen and heard
in the night. Others passed the gossip that
twenty men had been silently summoned from
a squad room in A Company, and twenty more
from a squad room in D Company.</p>

<p>"There's some mischief floating in the air&mdash;that's
certain," muttered Private Hyman.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to be up to see and hear
it all, Overton?" demanded Sergeant Gray.</p>

<p>Hal explained, frankly and briefly, but the sergeant's
eyes were keenly questioning.</p>

<p>Before the meal was over the company commander,
Captain Cortland, entered the room.</p>

<p>"Keep your seats, men. Go on with your
breakfast. Sergeant Gray, I will speak with
you for a moment."</p>

<p>The first sergeant hastily rose, going over to
his captain and saluting. After the company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
commander had gone, at the end of a brief, almost
whispered conversation, Gray came back
to his seat, looking wholly mysterious.</p>

<p>"B Company, rise," ordered the first sergeant,
at the end of the meal. "Attention!
The men of this company will have ten minutes
for recreation, then be prepared to fall in at an
extra inspection on the parade ground. After
filing out of here no man will go indoors again
before inspection."</p>

<p>"Is it to be inspection without arms, Sergeant
Gray?" called Sergeant Hupner.</p>

<p>"Inspection just as you stand," replied Sergeant
Gray, then gave the marching order.</p>

<p>"What on earth is up, Hal?" demanded Noll,
when the two young rookies met outside of mess
a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew," was Hal's puzzled reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>HAL UNDER A FIRE OF QUESTIONS</h3>


<div class='cap'>IMMEDIATELY after the bugle call for assembly
the four companies of the first battalion
of the Thirty-fourth fell in by companies
on the parade ground.</div>

<p>After roll-call had been read each company
commander stepped before his own command.</p>

<p>"Was any man of B Company absent from
his squad room at any time around two o'clock
this morning?" called Captain Cortland, looking
keenly over his command. Other company
commanders were asking the same question.
"If so, that man will fall out."</p>

<p>Not a man fell out of any of the four companies.</p>

<p>"Was any man in B Company up and moving
about the squad room at or about two o'clock
this morning?" was Captain Cortland's next
question. "If so, fall out."</p>

<p>Private Hal Overton quickly left his place in
the ranks.</p>

<p>"Advance, Private Overton," ordered Captain
Cortland.</p>

<p>Hal stepped forward, halting six paces from
his company commander and saluting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were up and about in the squad room
at that time, Private Overton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you leave the squad room?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You are positive of that?"</p>

<p>"Positive, sir."</p>

<p>"You did not leave the squad room, even for
a moment?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"What brought you out of your bed?"</p>

<p>"I heard shots, sir, and calls for the guard."</p>

<p>"What else did you see or hear, Private Overton?"</p>

<p>"I went to the window, and saw that there was
some excitement up by the officers' quarters,
sir."</p>

<p>"Then what did you do?"</p>

<p>"After listening and looking for some time,
sir, I returned to my bed, wondering what it
was all about."</p>

<p>Hal was the only soldier in the battalion who
had fallen out of ranks.</p>

<p>"Follow me," ordered Captain Cortland. He
led the young soldier back to where Adjutant
Wright and the sergeant-major were standing
by Major Silsbee.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Wright," reported Captain Cortland,
"Private Overton admits being up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the squad room at <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in the original text">the</ins> time when the shots were
fired in the dark hours this morning. He
claims that he did not leave the squad room,
and that it was the noise that woke him and
made him curious."</p>

<p>"Go to my office, Private Overton, with Sergeant-major
Beall," directed the adjutant
briefly.</p>

<p>Hal and the sergeant-major saluted, then
stepped away.</p>

<p>"Is it allowable, Sergeant, for a rookie to
ask what this is all about?" asked Hal respectfully,
as the two neared the adjutant's office
at headquarters.</p>

<p>"You'd better not ask. I'm not going to tell
you anything," replied Beall.</p>

<p>So Hal was silent, though he could hardly
escape the feeling that he was being treated a
good deal like a suspected criminal. Though
he knew that he was innocent of any wrong-doing
in connection with the excitement of the
night before he could not help feeling undefined
dread.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wright speedily returned to his
office, taking his seat at his desk. Hal was summoned
and made to stand at attention before the
adjutant.</p>

<p>"Now, Private Overton," began the adjutant,
fixing a frigid gaze on the rookie, "you may as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
well tell me all you know about last night's business."</p>

<p>Hal quickly told the little that he knew.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my man," retorted Lieutenant
Wright, "that much won't do. Out with the
rest of it."</p>

<p>"There isn't any 'rest of it' that I know of,
sir," Private Hal answered respectfully.</p>

<p>"Now, my man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With that preliminary Lieutenant Wright
proceeded to put the young recruit through a
severe, grilling cross-examination. But Hal
kept his head through it all, insisting that he had
told all he knew.</p>

<p>"Overton," rapped in the adjutant, at last,
"you are very new to the Army, and you don't
appear to realize all the facilities we have for
compelling men to speak. If you remain obtuse
any longer, it may be necessary for me to order
you to the guard-house under confinement."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Lieutenant," Hal replied,
flushing, "that you will not believe me. On my
word of honor as a soldier I have told you all
that I know of the matter."</p>

<p>The adjutant bent forward, looking keenly
into the rookie's eyes. Hal did not flinch, returning
the gaze steadily, respectfully.</p>

<p>Then, in a somewhat less gruff tone, Lieutenant
Wright continued:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is all for the present, Private Overton.
Report to your company commander, at
once."</p>

<p>The adjutant and sergeant-major left headquarters
a moment later, going by a different
path. As Hal glanced down the parade ground
he saw the men out of ranks, though every man
was still close to his place.</p>

<p>"Major," reported the adjutant, after the exchange
of salutes between the officers, "Private
Overton denies having left the squad room in
the early hours this morning. For that matter,
sir, if he had not been honest, he need not have
reported that he was out of his bed, or that he
heard the sentries' shots."</p>

<p>"It was well he did admit that much," replied
the major, "for he let it out at company mess
this morning."</p>

<p>"I went at the young recruit, sir, so severely
that I was almost ashamed of myself," continued
the adjutant. "I am under the impression,
sir, that Private Overton told me the
truth."</p>

<p>"So am I," admitted Major Silsbee thoughtfully.
"His record, so far, is against the idea
of his being mixed up in rascally business. I
think it likely that Private Overton's extreme
fault, if he is guilty of any, is that he is possibly
shielding some other soldiers whom he saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
sneak back into barracks after the excitement
was over. Probably he isn't even guilty of that
much."</p>

<p>"Are you going to search the squad <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'roms'">rooms</ins>,
sir?" inquired the adjutant.</p>

<p>"Yes, Wright, though it makes me feel almost
sick to put such an affront upon hundreds of
innocent and decent men."</p>

<p>"The decent ones, sir, will welcome the
search."</p>

<p>"That is what Colonel North told me. Summon
the company commanders, and direct them
to go into each squad room of their companies
with the sergeant in charge of the squad room."</p>

<p>Hal, in the meantime, had returned to B Company.
He found many of his comrades regarding
him suspiciously, and flushed in consequence.
But Corporal Cotter, Private Hyman and others
stepped over to him.</p>

<p>"What's it all about, rookie? Do you know?"
asked the corporal.</p>

<p>"Not a blessed thing, Corporal," replied the
young recruit.</p>

<p>"Look! Here come the company commanders
back," called another soldier, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Gray and the other sergeants of B
Company will follow me to barracks," called
Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>Now the curious soldiers saw each company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
commander, followed by his sergeants, step back
to barracks.</p>

<p>For an hour the puzzled men of the battalion
waited on the parade ground.</p>

<p>Then, in some mysterious manner, the news
of what had really happened began to spread.</p>

<p>In the night unknown men had broken into
Major Silsbee's house. This had not been a
difficult thing to do as, on a military post, doors
are rarely locked. Not one of the three entrances
to Major Silsbee's quarters had been
locked at the time.</p>

<p>Downstairs the thieves had gathered a few
articles together, but had not taken them, as
they had found better plunder upstairs. From
a dressing-room adjoining Mrs. Silsbee's sleeping
apartment the prowlers had taken a jewel
case containing jewels worth some three thousand
dollars. There had also been about two
hundred dollars in money in the case.</p>

<p>As the thieves were leaving the house they
were seen by a sentry some sixty yards away.
The sentry had challenged, then fired. The
thieves had fled, swiftly, running directly away
from all light. But another sentry had also seen
them, and had fired. Both sentries had agreed
that there were four men, and that they wore
the uniforms of soldiers.</p>

<p>The thieves made good their escape. Soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
after the alarm was given forty men from A
and D companies had been silently turned out
to aid in establishing a stronger guard, and the
barracks building had been watched through the
rest of the night.</p>

<p>Yet no soldier had been caught trying to get
back into barracks, nor had any man been missing
at roll-call unless well accounted for.</p>

<p>"Somewhere in this battalion, then," murmured
Noll to a man in C Company, "there are
four soldiers who are thieves."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the soldier bluntly, "and it
looks as though your bunkie at the recruit rendezvous
might know something about it."</p>

<p>"Hal Overton doesn't know," flared Noll
promptly, "or he'd have told!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE ANONYMOUS LETTER</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT was a four days' wonder, and then it
dropped.</div>

<p>The search at barracks had revealed
nothing. There was not a soldier on the post
against whom any tangible suspicion pointed.</p>

<p>"There's just one way that a clue might be
found," muttered Private Bill Hooper, one
morning in Sergeant Hupner's squad room.
"In time it may turn out that a sweetheart of
some soldier gets some pretty jewelry trinkets
given to her."</p>

<p>He glared covertly, though meaningly, at Hal
Overton.</p>

<p>But Hal was far enough away neither to see
nor to hear Hooper's fling.</p>

<p>"You'll never get caught on that trick, Bill,"
jeered Private Hyman. "No girl would look
at you, even if you displayed the whole of the
missing jewelry."</p>

<p>"I've had my share of sweethearts in my
day," growled big Private Hooper.</p>

<p>"That was before your face changed for
worse," grinned Hyman.</p>

<p>"Don't get gay with me," warned Hooper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
sulkily, "or your face may suffer some
changes!"</p>

<p>"Go over and thump the kid," proposed Hyman.</p>

<p>It was Hal who was meant by the term "kid."</p>

<p>"I don't like that youngster," muttered
Hooper. "And I don't trust him, either."</p>

<p>"That'll never worry Hal Overton," smiled
Hyman. "Hooper, you look so untidy that it's
a wonder Sergeant Hupner doesn't 'call' you
oftener for it. And you clean up your rifle
about once a fortnight. Look at Overton over
there."</p>

<p>Hal was at work with his kit of cleaning tools,
going over his rifle as methodically and industriously
as though it were a piece of rare silver
plate.</p>

<p>"He'll rub and polish that old piece of his
until he wears it out," mumbled Hooper.</p>

<p>"One of the surest signs of the good soldier
is when you see him putting in a lot of his spare
time caring for his uniforms and equipments,"
broke in Sergeant Hupner, behind them.
"Hooper, go and brush your uniform, and clean
your boots and polish 'em. I'll report you, if
I see you so slouchy in the future."</p>

<p>Bill Hooper moved away, scowling.</p>

<p>Sergeant Gray strode in at that moment.</p>

<p>"Do you want leave to go to town to-day, reporting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
back at tattoo, Hyman?" inquired the
first sergeant.</p>

<p>"Thank you, yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll turn you in on the list to Captain
Cortland. I'll notify you of leave within
half an hour."</p>

<p>Then he stepped over to Hal.</p>

<p>"Overton, you haven't had any leave to visit
town since you joined. Would you like to take
leave to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant, thank you."</p>

<p>Sergeant Gray looked his surprise.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I have too much to learn right here, Sergeant.
I'm going to stick, and work, until I'm
out of the recruit class."</p>

<p>"Good boy!" murmured Gray, in an undertone,
and passed on. But Gray stopped when
he came up with Hupner.</p>

<p>"Hupner, you've got a valuable man in Overton."</p>

<p>"I know it, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Give him all the little points you can that
will take him out of the recruit class promptly."</p>

<p>"Why, Sergeant," smiled Hupner, "Overton
can go out of the recruit class at about any
time now. Report him for the guard detail any
time that you want. He'll make good. He's
keen on every bit of his work. He can go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
through his manual of arms like a juggler. He
has studied his infantry drill regulations until
he's about worn the book out; he knows his manual
of guard duty by heart, and it would be
mighty hard to trip him anywhere in his small
arms firing manual. Have you noticed his facings
and his marching at drill?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Sergeant Gray thoughtfully.
"The boy's a good one, all right."</p>

<p>"Take it from me, Sergeant&mdash;you needn't
hesitate to detail the kid for guard or any other
duty. He'll suit Captain Cortland."</p>

<p>"I'll detail him for guard, then, as soon as
I can," returned Sergeant Gray. "That gives
a young soldier confidence as soon as anything
else ever does."</p>

<p>As often as is practicable enlisted men are
given a day's leave, with permission to go off
post and visit the nearest town. This leave is
given to men known to be of good conduct. A
"bad" soldier, when one is found, gets little in
the way of leave.</p>

<p>Whenever a soldier or an ex-soldier is found
slandering the Army service it is invariably
safe to set him down as a man who, through
very poor soldierly qualities, or actual viciousness,
got "in the bad books" of his officers.
There is every desire on the part of regimental
and company officers to make it pleasant for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
truly good soldier, and to keep him in the service
until he has reached retiring age.</p>

<p>The man who gets into bad company when
away on leave is the soldier who has the most
difficulty in getting leave another time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the soldier of good conduct
can have much leave during the month.
It is a practice at many posts, when a man has a
trade, and can get small jobs to do near the
post, to allow him as many half days for that
work as may be granted him without injury to
the service. In this way handy men or mechanics
among the soldiers often add many dollars
to their pocket money.</p>

<p>As Private Bill Hooper went away to clean
up his uniform and shoes, Hal blithely kept at
work putting his rifle in A 1 order.</p>

<p>Both were interrupted, half an hour later, by
the bugle call for separate company drill.</p>

<p>Private Overton was among the first on the
drill ground. His clothing looked as though it
had just come from the tailor's; his rifle had the
appearance of being fresh from the arsenal.</p>

<p>"There's a man for you, Hyman," spoke Sergeant
Hupner, in an undertone. "If the kid
keeps on as he has started he'll be a winner."</p>

<p>"I've had my eye on him," nodded Private
Hyman. "He seems to be good all the way
through."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is he ever a little bit fresh in the squad
room?" continued Sergeant Hupner.</p>

<p>"If the kid is," replied Hyman, "I've never
happened to be around at that time. But he
stands up for himself when he has to. I suppose
you've heard, Sergeant, how he trimmed
Bill Hooper off?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Hupner; "that sort of thing
won't hurt Hooper at all, either."</p>

<p>"Hooper may lay for a chance to accuse
Overton of something in the squad room that
the kid didn't do."</p>

<p>"I'll have my eyes open for Hooper," replied
Hupner dryly. "I haven't anything against
any of the other sergeants in this battalion, but
I really wish some other sergeant had Hooper
in his squad room."</p>

<p>"B Company fall in," sounded the voice of
Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>First Lieutenant Hampton and the sergeants
hastened to their posts, while the corporals and
privates went to their places in the ranks.</p>

<p>The command for open order was given, after
which Captain Cortland commanded:</p>

<p>"Inspect the second platoon, Lieutenant
Hampton."</p>

<p>With that the company commander himself
passed behind the backs of the men of the first
platoon, looking each man over keenly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Private Hooper, fall out!" ordered Captain
Cortland sharply.</p>

<p>When the captain had finished his own work,
and Lieutenant Hampton had reported all men
in the second platoon to be soldierly in appearance,
Captain Cortland turned to Bill Hooper
with a look of disapproval.</p>

<p>"Private Hooper, this is the third time within
a month that you've failed to report in neat
and soldierly appearance. Who is in charge of
your squad room?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Hupner, sir."</p>

<p>"Sergeant Hupner," resumed the captain,
"what have you to say to this man's appearance?"</p>

<p>"I ordered him, at least a half an hour ago,
sir, to clean himself up."</p>

<p>"Keep right after Private Hooper, Sergeant.
If he fails again to keep himself as a soldier
should, report him to the first sergeant."</p>

<p>Hooper's face burned darkly. Even honest
Sergeant Hupner flushed. A shiftless soldier
is a sore trial to the sergeant responsible for
him.</p>

<p>Now, at the brisk command, B Company
moved off in column of fours. A long practice
march followed. While out, the company was
halted and drilled searchingly. It was a hard
morning's work, B Company returning just in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
time for dinner. In the afternoon there was
another drill. Parade wound up the day.</p>

<p>On his return from parade Lieutenant Wright,
the adjutant, found in his office mail a letter
that caused him a good deal of astonishment.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Watch Private Overton, B. Company, if you want to
find a man who knows a lot about the robbery the other
night. He has been acting suspiciously, and I have it from
a man in his squad room that Overton sometimes talks in
his sleep in a way to show that either he was one of the
robbers, or else that he knows who they are.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>A SECRET COWARD</h3>


<div class='cap'>IF any official notice was taken of that lying
anonymous note the rascally writer thereof
did not have the satisfaction of discovering
it for some time to come.</div>

<p>Duties in the battalion went on, as usual, at
Fort Clowdry, the next day.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, however, came a brief
battalion drill, followed by the glorious spectacle
of dress parade.</p>

<p>After the regimental band had played the
colors down the line, and the other ceremonies
had been observed, Adjutant Wright took his
post to publish the orders.</p>

<p>These were few, and the reading did not occupy
long. As the officer returned the papers
to the breast of his coat the men expected to see
him step back. Instead, however, the adjutant
sharply called:</p>

<p>"Battalion, attention! I am directed by the
battalion commander to make an inquiry. Each
man will pay close heed, and answer if he is able.
Has any non-commissioned officer or private in
this battalion heard, at any time lately, any man
in the same squad room with him talk in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
sleep in such a way as to indicate that the
man talking in his sleep had any knowledge
concerning the men who recently broke into
and robbed the battalion commander's quarters?
Any man having such knowledge will
fall out."</p>

<p>There was a tense silence, but the ranks of the
first battalion remained intact.</p>

<p>"If there is any non-commissioned officer or
private who did not fully understand my question,
he will fall out," continued the adjutant.</p>

<p>Still no man fell out.</p>

<p>"If the man who addressed the anonymous
letter to the battalion adjutant is present he will
step out," continued Lieutenant Wright.</p>

<p>Still the ranks remained unbroken.</p>

<p>Being at "attention," each man in the four
companies was looking fixedly ahead. But curiosity
was running wild under all those blue
fatigue blouses!</p>

<p>"An anonymous letter has been received at
battalion headquarters," continued the adjutant
sternly. "This letter accuses a soldier, who
is named, of having guilty knowledge concerning
the perpetrators of the robbery of the other
night. The writer of this letter asserts that
other men in the squad room have heard the
anonymously accused soldier talking in his sleep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in such a manner as to implicate the accused in
the robbery.</p>

<p>"No man present has acknowledged having
heard such talk. Either some soldiers now in
ranks have lied in denying having heard such
talk, or else the writer of the anonymous letter
is a liar. I am directed by the battalion commander
to state his belief that the writer of the
anonymous letter is the liar.</p>

<p>"The writer of the letter has been ordered to
fall out and reveal himself. If that writer is
present, then he knows in his own mind, and one
of these days his comrades will know, that he is
too much of a coward to face responsibility for
his sneaking action.</p>

<p>"The man who writes an anonymous letter is
always a coward, a sneak, and usually a liar,
too. I am directed by the battalion commander
to state that, if the writer of this anonymous
letter can be found, he will be placed on trial for
his act, which is one unworthy of a soldier.</p>

<p>"I am further directed by the battalion commander
to state that no letter anonymously accusing
an enlisted man will react in any way
against the accused. The battalion commander
feels that he cannot state, too strongly, his intense
contempt for any coward who will resort
to slandering a comrade in an anonymous letter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"The battalion commander will be glad, at
any time, to receive from any man in his command
any information or report that may be
made honestly and for the good of the service.
But the man making such report will go to headquarters
and make it in person, or else will put
his information in writing and sign it fully and
manfully."</p>

<p>After an impressive pause Adjutant Wright
stepped back, saluted his commanding officer,
then stepped to his proper position.</p>

<p>At a signal from the adjutant the buglers
now sounded retreat. As the last notes died
out the sunset gun was fired. Rifles flew to
"present arms," swords flashed to salute and
male civilian onlookers uncovered their heads
while the band crashed out with "The Star
Spangled Banner."</p>

<p>As the band played, the Flag fluttered down
from the peak of the post flag staff and descended
into the hands of its defenders. One
man stood in the ranks at that moment who was
unfit to touch even the border of that national
emblem.</p>

<p>"Order arms!" rang out, as the last note
died out. "Right shoulder arms!"</p>

<p>Then by column of fours the battalion
marched briskly off the field, to be halted and
dismissed near barracks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner were the men in their quarters than
the same angry inquiry rose in each squad room:</p>

<p>"Who has been writing lying letters about a
comrade?"</p>

<p>No one admitted being the dastard, of course,
yet over at headquarters Major Silsbee, at that
very moment, was asking:</p>

<p>"What makes you so very sure, Wright, that
some man in this command wrote the anonymous
letter?"</p>

<p>"It is all very simple, sir," replied the adjutant.
"Look at the note again, sir, and you'll
see that it is typewritten&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, Wright; I've known that from
the first."</p>

<p>"But, sir, it's written in the style of type
that is used on the Everite typewriter. This
post is equipped with Everite typewriters;
we have them here at headquarters, and every
first sergeant has one, too, for his clerk."</p>

<p>"And there may be a dozen more Everite
typewriters over in Clowdry," suggested Major
Silsbee dubiously.</p>

<p>"No, Major; I've made an investigation. I
have a list of every firm or person in Clowdry
who owns a machine&mdash;only about a dozen in all,
and not one of them is an Everite. Major, the
letter was written on this post, and with an
Everite machine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, by the great guns, sir, I hope you go
further and catch the culprit," exploded Major
Silsbee, bringing his fist down on the desk.</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed Lieutenant Wright. "That's
just where the trouble is. It will be a hard
task, sir."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE LUCK OF THE YOUNG RECRUIT</h3>


<div class='cap'>ON top of all this came the news that
Colonel North's quarters had been entered
the night following.</div>

<p>Worse, the scoundrels had used chloroform
this time. Colonel North awoke at about three
in the morning, his head feeling heavy and dull.
He noted at once the strange odor in the room.
Then he roused his family. Traces of thieves
were found; within ten seconds after that
Colonel North had summoned the guard.</p>

<p>Yet the two sentries on duty in officers' row
both declared that they had seen no prowlers.</p>

<p>Almost every article of value had been found
and taken. A pair of costly revolvers belonging
to the regimental commander had gone with the
loot. Some money, too, had been found and
taken. Colonel North and his family placed
their loss at nearly four thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Ray," said Colonel North, to the
officer of the day, who had followed the guard,
"I think you had better summon Major Silsbee
at once."</p>

<p>The major was there, inside of five minutes.</p>

<p>"So the scoundrels have blistered you, too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
sir?" demanded the white-faced battalion commander
wrathfully.</p>

<p>"They have taken almost everything in the
way of valuable property that Mrs. North and I
own, Major."</p>

<p>"We've got to put a stop to this, sir. And
we've got to find and bring the rascals to boot."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Colonel; shall I pass the order
for a prompt search of barracks?" queried the
officer of the day.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Ray," replied Colonel North
promptly. "Until I have real proof I'm not
going to put the slight upon our enlisted men.
I believe they're all fine men. If I had taken
more time to think I never would have sanctioned
the last search of barracks. It shan't happen
again."</p>

<p>Captain Ruggles of A Company, having heard
some excitement along the row, now came in.</p>

<p>"What we might, and perhaps ought to do,
Major," continued the Colonel, "is to advise the
married officers whose homes have not yet been
robbed that they will do well to send their valuables
into town for safe-keeping at the bank for
the present."</p>

<p>"We might, sir," assented Silsbee dryly.
"The bank in Clowdry is under the protection
of a police force of less than a dozen men.
Shall we admit, Colonel, that a dozen policemen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
are safer guardians of property than our four
hundred men of the Regular Army?"</p>

<p>Colonel North looked troubled at that way of
putting the matter.</p>

<p>"I believe Mrs. Ruggles and I have some
things worth stealing," broke in Captain Ruggles
quietly. "But I feel certain that neither
of us would like to throw any slight over the
ability of this battalion to protect its own property."</p>

<p>"My head isn't very clear yet," admitted
Colonel North. "I realize that I have made a
poor suggestion. I don't imagine, Major, that
you'd be much better pleased if I directed you
to double the guard."</p>

<p>"I shall obey, of course, Colonel, any orders
on that subject that you may give me," replied
Major Silsbee.</p>

<p>"These robberies are likely to continue, at
intervals, until the quarters of all married officers
have been entered and despoiled, sir," suggested
Captain Ruggles, "so it seems to me, sir,
that it would be wise to put each guard on its
mettle."</p>

<p>"I am thinking only of protecting you gentlemen
who have not yet sustained losses," continued
Colonel North.</p>

<p>"And we appreciate your solicitude greatly,
sir," resumed Major Silsbee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"I leave it to you, Major."</p>

<p>"Then I shall make it my business, sir, to see
to it that the men are instructed to be more
alert than ever in guard duty," replied Silsbee.</p>

<p>The next morning the news, of course, traveled
swiftly all through the garrison.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll had a chance to chat together
for a few minutes before the sounding of the
first assembly after breakfast.</p>

<p>"The thieves are around again," mused Noll
aloud.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Private Hal thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I wish we might catch the rascals at it."</p>

<p>"You've got time enough to think out your
plan, then," laughed Hal, in mild derision at
this suggestion.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Well, the thieves are not due for a few days
yet on their next raid. It seems to be their
plan to leave intervals between their raids."</p>

<p>"If the burglars are scheming further attempts
they may vary their plans by coming
again to-night," hinted Noll.</p>

<p>"I hardly believe they will," replied Hal,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>That day at noon Sergeant Gray warned Hal
for guard the following day. Just after dinner
Hal found that his chum Noll had also been
warned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the thieves are coming again I hope it will
be to-morrow night," suggested Hal.</p>

<p>"No good," retorted Noll cynically.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"We're only rooks."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"There isn't a ghost of a chance that we'd
be put on post up in officers' row. The oldest
and keenest soldiers will be put on that duty
every night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so," sighed Hal. "Of course
rookies are just rooks. We'll get the post down
by the commissary stores, where a wagon train
would be needed for stealing anything really
worth money."</p>

<p>At guard mount the next morning both recruits
turned out spick and span. Knowing
that they could not expect to get any important
posts for night tours both boys hoped to be selected
by the officer of the day for orderly duty.
But two older soldiers were chosen for that.
When guard mount was over Sergeant Hupner,
as commander of the guard, marched the new
guard over to the guard-house, where the old
guard was relieved.</p>

<p>This was the first time that the rookies had
been detailed to guard duty since joining their
regiment. No matter to what inconsequential
posts they might be assigned both were full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
determination to show themselves model sentries.</p>

<p>During the day Hal and Noll, who were assigned
to the same relief, had two tours. The
first was in officers' row; the second, which
ended just before dark, was down at the main
entrance of the post.</p>

<p>Then followed some hours for leisure and
sleep.</p>

<p>"You men will go on post again at two in the
morning," announced Corporal Sanders, who
was in command of the relief to which the rookies
belonged.</p>

<p>Punctually that relief was turned out, aligned,
inspected and instructed.</p>

<p>"Post number three, Private Overton. Post
number four, Private Terry," ran the corporal's
orders. "Post number five&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>Hal's heart was already beating high with
hope. He had the post along officers' row, Noll
the one just beyond.</p>

<p>"All sentries will exercise unusual vigilance,"
announced Sergeant Hupner, as commander of
the guard. "This applies especially to the sentries
on posts number three and four. But let
no sentry, anywhere, allow his whole attention
to wander from his duties for an instant. Corporal,
march the relief."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Attention," called Corporal Sanders on receiving
this order. "Right shoulder arms! By
twos, left march!"</p>

<p>Three minutes later the man on post three had
been relieved, Hal having been dropped into his
place.</p>

<p>It was just after two o'clock in the morning
when Private Hal Overton began to pace his
post, watching the relief vanish in the darkness
in the direction of post number four.</p>

<p>Then he heard a sentry's hail:</p>

<p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"The relief."</p>

<p>"Advance, relief."</p>

<p>After that, the steps of the marching party
died off in the distance.</p>

<p>In the darkest part of the moonless night Hal
walked up and down before the officers' quarters.</p>

<p>But he did more than walk. Making his own
steps as noiseless as possible Hal felt that he
was truly "all ears and eyes."</p>

<p>Thus some twenty minutes went by.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, just as Hal had passed the
north side of Captain Ruggles' quarters the
young sentry halted like a flash.</p>

<p>Under the dim starlight he saw two shadowy
forms leave by the captain's back door.</p>

<p>Each carried a bundle, though Hal could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
make out the size or shape of either very distinctly.</p>

<p>"The burglars&mdash;at their tricks!" flashed Hal
exultantly.</p>

<p>But he wasted no time thinking. In a twinkling
he slipped a cartridge into his rifle, bringing
the piece to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he challenged. "Who's there?"</p>

<p>The two figures, crouching low, made a bolt
for the tall corn in a vegetable garden at the
rear of the grounds.</p>

<p>"As fast as he could shout the words Private
Hal Overton shouted:</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there? Halt! Who's there?"</p>

<p>Having obeyed a sentry's instructions to challenge
three times, and receiving no answer, Hal
pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>A flash of flame lit the darkness around the
rifle. It leaped straight from the muzzle.</p>

<p>Bang! The bullet sped in among the corn
stalks.</p>

<p>Over it all sounded Hal's voice:</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard, post number three!"</p>

<p>Hal shot back the bolt of his rifle, dropping in
a cartridge with fingers as steady as at drill.</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard, post number three!"</p>

<p>The gate was too far away. Hal took the
fence at a bound, carrying his cocked piece with
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Straight to the growing corn the young private
took his speedy way.</p>

<p>"Come out and show yourselves, or I fire at
once," Private Overton shouted.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! Two pistol shots rang out
from the corn patch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE DUEL IN THE DARK</h3>


<div class='cap'>ALL this had occupied but a few seconds.</div>

<p>Private Hal Overton was on duty,
and bent on business.</p>

<p>"I'll get one, or both of the rascals&mdash;dead or
alive!" flashed through his mind.</p>

<p>Not even those two pistol shots brought him
to a halt.</p>

<p>Yet one of the bullets struck the ground beside
him as he raced, the other fanning his left
cheek with a little breeze.</p>

<p>"Get back there, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bo'">boy</ins>!" growled a gruff voice.
"You don't want to be killed, do you?"</p>

<p>For answer Hal sighted swiftly and fired.</p>

<p>Then, for an instant, he dropped to one knee.</p>

<p>From out of the corn patch a curse reached
his ears.</p>

<p>"If you'd rather be a dead soldier, all right,"
came the ugly response. "Give it to him good
and hot!"</p>

<p>Hal had already slipped back the bolt of his
piece. Now, as fast as he could handle the material,
and while still down on one knee, he
slipped five cartridges into his magazine, and a
sixth he drove home in the chamber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Bright flashes, swift reports greeted him from
two points in the corn patch. These points were
about twenty feet apart.</p>

<p>The young soldier simply couldn't cover both
points of attack.</p>

<p>From the way the bullets whistled past his
face and body the recruit knew that both his enemies
were firing in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>And now, from a third point, another assailant
joined in the firing, and Hal marveled, with
each second, that he still remained alive. He
felt as though he were the center of a leaden
storm.</p>

<p>Yet, as coolly as he could, Soldier Hal chose
the man at the left and drove two shots straight
in the direction of the flashes.</p>

<p>"He's got me," yelled a cursing voice.</p>

<p>"I'll get you all, if you don't stop shooting
and come out," warned Overton coolly.</p>

<p>He could hear the wounded man moving
rather swiftly through the corn.</p>

<p>"He ought to leave a trail of blood," thought
Hal, swiftly, and turned his attention to the
next enemy.</p>

<p>But that man had stopped his firing.</p>

<p>Then Hal turned his rifle in the direction of
the flashes from the pistol farthest away.</p>

<p>Bang! He sent one shot there, and the shooting
of the unknown stopped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Hal Dropped to One Knee.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Private Overton, however, could not know
whether he had hit the fellow.</p>

<p>"That fellow in the middle may be left yet,"
breathed Hal Overton, "I'll find out."</p>

<p>He had three shots yet left in his magazine,
and his piece was at cock.</p>

<p>Rising, he made swiftly for the corn, and dived
in.</p>

<p>"Back for your life!" sounded a voice
straight ahead.</p>

<p>Crack! crack!</p>

<p>Two pistols shots fanned his face.</p>

<p>But Hal took another running bound forward,
preferring to reserve his fire until he could
catch a good glimpse of the fellow's body.</p>

<p>"Back, you fool!" hissed the voice, followed
by two more shots.</p>

<p>"Come out with your hands up, or I'll get
you!" Hal retorted.</p>

<p>Instead, the unknown and unseen turned and
ran some fifty feet.</p>

<p>Hal pursued, without shooting.</p>

<p>Crack! crack!</p>

<p>For an instant Hal felt almost dizzy with sudden
dread, for those flashes seemed almost to
smite him in the face.</p>

<p>Yes, he was afraid, for a brief space. The
coward is not the man who is afraid, but the man
who allows his fear to overmaster him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fire again," yelled Hal, "and I'll know just
where to send a bullet."</p>

<p>As he rushed onward he came out of the corn
patch.</p>

<p>Fifty feet further on he saw the fugitive, just
dropping to the ground at the roots of a tree.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack!</p>

<p>Lying on the ground, his head hardly showing
beyond the roots, the fugitive was now in excellent
position to stop the young sentry's rush.</p>

<p>Whizz&mdash;zz! whizz&mdash;zz! Click!</p>

<p>Two of the speeding bullets flew past Hal's
head. The third struck and glanced off the rifle
butt just as Hal, dropping to one knee, was raising
the piece to his shoulder to sight.</p>

<p>Bang! That was Hal's rifle, again in action.
He had aimed swiftly, but deliberately, for the
base of the tree.</p>

<p>Against the military rifle of to-day an ordinary
tree offers no protection. The American
Army rifle, at short range, will send a bullet
through three feet of green oak.</p>

<p>"Wow!" yelled the other. Though Hal did
not then know it, the bullet had driven a handful
of dirt into the fellow's mouth.</p>

<p>Hal could hear the rascal spitting, so he
called:</p>

<p>"Come <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and'">on</ins> out and surrender, and I won't
fire again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"You go to blazes!" yelled an angry voice.</p>

<p>Muffled as the voice was, it had a strangely
familiar sound to the young soldier.</p>

<p>Hal seized the chance to fill his magazine as
he shot the bolt back. He slipped another cartridge
into the chamber.</p>

<p>From the sounds beyond he knew that his
enemy was also reloading.</p>

<p>"Any time you want me to stop shooting,"
Hal coolly announced, "just call out that you
surrender."</p>

<p>Then he brought his piece to his shoulder.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>He could hear the bullet strike with a thud.</p>

<p>Had there been light Hal could have scored
a hit, but all shooting in the dark is mainly guesswork.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! The fugitive's pistol was also
in action.</p>

<p>One of the bullets carried the young soldier's
sombrero from his head, but he was barely aware
of the fact. Yet, had that bullet been aimed two
inches lower, it would have found a resting place
in his brain.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Hal fired his second shot with deliberation.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" wailed the other, with a new
note of fear in his voice.</p>

<p>"Surrender!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Crack! crack!</p>

<p>Two pistol shots made up the reply.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've got to kill him, if he doesn't
get me first."</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>"Ow&mdash;ow&mdash;ow&mdash;ow!" That yell was genuine
enough to show that the young sentry's bullet
had struck flesh.</p>

<p>"Do you surrender?"</p>

<p>"Not to you!"</p>

<p>Hal fired again. Then he crouched low,
slipping two more cartridges into his rifle.</p>

<p>Crack! crack!</p>

<p>"I'll get you yet," called a furious voice.</p>

<p>Hal started as though he had been shot,
though he was not aware of a hit.</p>

<p>"Tip Branders!" he called, in astonishment,
and fired again.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me," came the admission. "Hal
Overton, are you going to kill an old friend?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN CORTLAND HEADS THE PURSUIT</h3>


<div class='cap'>AWAY over by post number four Hal
heard three rifle shots ring out.
But he paid no heed. Instead he answered
the now terrorized wretch in front of
him:</div>

<p>"I'll have to kill you, unless you surrender!"</p>

<p>"Then I'll get you first," came the defiant answer.</p>

<p>From the flashes, it could now be seen that
Tip Branders was firing with a revolver in each
hand.</p>

<p>The bullets came in so swift and close that
Private Hal Overton expected, every instant, to
be bowled over.</p>

<p>But still he fired deliberately, though he now
strove to make each shot effective.</p>

<p>In a few moments he fired next to the last cartridge
in his magazine, just as the furious revolver
fusillade came to an end.</p>

<p>"O-o-oh!"</p>

<p>Then the young sentry felt, rather than saw,
something topple over at the base of the tree.</p>

<p>Hal leaped up, at the same instant hearing
some one run up behind him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>That brought the young sentry about like a
flash.</p>

<p>"I'm Captain Ruggles, Sentry!" came the
prompt hail, and Private Overton recognized
the voice.</p>

<p>Then Hal wheeled the other way, rushing toward
the tree, calling back as he ran:</p>

<p>"I think I got the scoundrel, sir."</p>

<p>In another moment Hal was beside the tree,
holding his rifle clubbed and ready, in case Tip
Branders was playing 'possum.</p>

<p>But the fellow lay on the ground, curiously
huddled up, not moving a hand.</p>

<p>"I got him with that last shot, sir," announced
Private Overton, turning and carefully saluting
his officer.</p>

<p>"You've had a brisk and brave fight, Sentry,"
cried Captain Ruggles warmly. "I heard
your first shot, and rushed here as fast as I could
come."</p>

<p>In reality, long as the time had seemed,
hardly more than a full minute had passed.
Captain Ruggles, with a pair of white-striped
trousers drawn on over his pajamas, and slippers
on his feet, presented a picture of speed.</p>

<p>Hal bent beside his old enemy of the home
town to see where Tip had been hit.</p>

<p>Captain Ruggles, changing his revolver to his
left hand, drew a match and struck it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Tip's first apparent wound was a graze at the
top of his right shoulder. A dark, red stain
appeared there. Another bullet had grazed his
right wrist.</p>

<p>The third wound apparent was at the right
side of the chest.</p>

<p>"It'll need a rain-maker (Army surgeon) to
tell whether that bullet touched the scoundrel's
right lung," declared Captain Ruggles.</p>

<p>At that instant a woman's voice sounded from
one of the windows of the house behind them:</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard, you'll find Captain
Ruggles and the sentry somewhere back of the
garden."</p>

<p>Then came the sounds of running feet. Corporal
Sanders was coming with the guard.</p>

<p>That incident showed the young soldier, more
clearly than anything else could have done, how
brief the duel between Tip and himself had
been.</p>

<p>For Hal knew that, when the alarm is sounded,
accompanied by the sound of a shot, the corporal
and the guard come on the dead run.</p>

<p>"Right here, Corporal of the guard!" shouted
Captain Ruggles, standing up. "Send one man
back immediately for hospital men and a
stretcher."</p>

<p>"Hospital men and a stretcher, Davidson,"
called the corporal, and one soldier detached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
himself from the running squad, wheeling and
racing back.</p>

<p>Then the corporal of the guard dashed up at
the head of his men, giving Captain Ruggles
the rifle salute by bringing his left hand smartly
against the barrel of his piece.</p>

<p>Barely behind the guard came Lieutenant
Hayes, of A Company, who was officer of the
day.</p>

<p>"The sentry has caught one of the burglars,
Hayes," called Captain Ruggles, as the lieutenant
came up on the run.</p>

<p>"Glad of it, sir. It's about time."</p>

<p>Then, turning to Hal, Lieutenant Hayes continued:</p>

<p>"You're sentry on number three, Private
Overton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Make your report in as few words as you
can."</p>

<p>This Hal did, telling about the two men whom
he saw sneaking away with bundles, and also
about the third man who had joined in firing at
him.</p>

<p>"Which way did the other two retreat, Private
Overton?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't see, sir," the young soldier answered.
"I was in the corn at that moment."</p>

<p>The corporal of the guard, in the meantime,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
had sent another man to relieve Noll Terry on
post number four, directing Terry to report to
the officer of the day.</p>

<p>Still another member of the guard had been
placed on post number three.</p>

<p>All the other commissioned officers on post,
including Colonel North, now appeared, and the
investigating party was adjourned to the roadway.</p>

<p>Noll reported that he had seen two fugitives
at a distance, and had fired three times.</p>

<p>Under military discipline matters move rapidly.
Soldiers with lanterns were now searching
for the trail of those who had escaped.
Keen eyes were also seeking either bundle of
loot from Captain Ruggles's quarters. It was
thought that the thieves, in their haste to get
away, might have dropped their plunder.</p>

<p>Tip Branders, still unconscious, and badly
hurt, according to the surgeon, was taken to the
post hospital, and the civil authorities in Clowdry
were notified.</p>

<p>"That fellow you shot called you by name,
didn't he, Overton?" inquired Captain Ruggles.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal admitted.</p>

<p>"Ah, you knew the fellow, then?" inquired
Colonel North. He spoke blandly, but he had
an instant recollection of the anonymous note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
that had been received at battalion headquarters.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal spoke promptly. "The fellow
is Tip Branders. He comes from the same
home town that I do. He tried to enlist in the
Army, but was rejected because he could not
supply good enough references. Then he ran
away from home, taking with him some money
he stole from his mother, according to local accounts."</p>

<p>"Did you know the fellow Branders was in
this part of the world?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then why, Private Overton, did you not report
your information promptly to your officers?"</p>

<p>"Why, I did not have the least idea, sir, that
Branders was still in this neighborhood, and I
did not, at any time, connect him in my mind
with the robberies."</p>

<p>"How often, and where, have you seen Branders
in this part of the country?" demanded
Colonel North, impressively, while the other officers
looked on with keen interest.</p>

<p>Hal flushed, for he felt that now he was under
some suspicion himself.</p>

<p>"I have seen Branders just once, sir," the recruit
replied. "Private Terry was with me at
the time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"This man here?" inquired Colonel North,
turning to glance at Noll, who stood by.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"When did you both see Branders, then?"</p>

<p>"Our first day here, sir. You may recall,
Colonel, that you told Terry and me that we
need not go on duty that first day, but that we
might have the day to ourselves, as a reward
for having helped Major Davis in that mail-train
affair the night before our arrival at this
post."</p>

<p>"I remember," nodded Colonel North. "But
you have not yet told me the circumstances of
your meeting with Branders."</p>

<p>Hal hurriedly recounted the details of that
meeting, among the rocks past the ledge, out on
the road leading westward from the post.</p>

<p>"At that time, Colonel," Private Hal Overton
continued, "Branders told us he was headed
for a ranch to the westward, where he expected
to get a job. We had no reason for disbelieving
him, at the time, and so it never even occurred
to us, until to-night, that he might be one of the
burglars who have been looting this post. Besides,
sir, though Tip had always been known as
a rather worthless fellow, we had never heard
of his being the associate of downright criminals."</p>

<p>Now the searchers came in to report that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
could find neither a trail nor any sight of
dropped bundles of loot.</p>

<p>"At daylight, Major," suggested Colonel
North to Major Silsbee, "you may be able to
send out scouts who, with a better light, may
succeed in finding a trail."</p>

<p>Hal turned to Lieutenant Hayes, saluting.</p>

<p>"I wonder, sir, if it won't be best for me to
offer a suggestion to Colonel North?"</p>

<p>The regimental commander turned at once.</p>

<p>"You may speak, Private Overton."</p>

<p>"I was about to inquire, sir," replied Hal,
saluting, "if it isn't likely that there may be
a good hiding place for thieves among the
rocks back of the ledge of which I spoke some
time ago."</p>

<p>"What makes you think the thieves may be
there, Overton?"</p>

<p>"The thought has just struck me, sir, that
Branders was probably lurking about in the vicinity
of a cave or other place of concealment,
on the day that he threw the stone at us. It
struck me, sir, that a squad of men might search
that locality with the chance of finding the rest
of Branders's associates and also of recovering
much of the stuff that has been stolen from
quarters on this post."</p>

<p>"That's a bright suggestion, worth working
upon. Cortland, will you take a detachment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
men and hasten out to that locality? Post men
all around while it is still dark, and then, with
a few men, plunge right through that neighborhood.
Overton and Terry will go with you as
guides, so that you may strike the exact spot
without loss of time."</p>

<p>Captain Cortland dispatched a soldier to go
at once to Sergeant Hupner's squad room, with
orders to turn out the men in that room at once
and under arms, with fifty rounds of ammunition
per man.</p>

<p>This done, Captain Cortland hastened to his
own quarters, soon returning with his sword
hanging at his belt and his revolver in its holster.</p>

<p>"While you are gone, Cortland," said Colonel
North, "Silsbee and I will make whatever other
investigations we can think of."</p>

<p>In an almost incredibly short space of time
Sergeant Hupner's squad was ready, and turned
into officers' row.</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry, you will walk ahead of
the detachment, and I will go with you," Captain
Cortland announced. "Sergeant Hupner,
march your detachment in column of twos,
twenty paces to the rear of the guides. Forward!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE STIRRING GAME AT DAWN</h3>


<div class='cap'>"THERE is the ledge, sir, right in yonder,"
announced Hal, peering through
the darkness. A wind was coming up
and the stars had faded. It was in the darkest
hour before dawn.</div>

<p>Captain Cortland stepped back, holding out
one hand as a signal.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner saw, and halted his detachment,
marching almost without a sound.</p>

<p>"Remain here, guides, with the detachment,"
directed the company commander, in a whisper.
"Sergeant Hupner, you and I will go forward
and reconnoitre."</p>

<p>As soon as the officer and the non-commissioned
officer had departed Private Bill Hooper
growled out:</p>

<p>"What kind of a fool chase is this you've got
us into, Overton?"</p>

<p>"Silence in the ranks," hissed Corporal Cotter
sharply. "Not a word!"</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Captain Cortland and
the sergeant returned.</p>

<p>"Take twelve of the men, now, Sergeant.
You know where to post them," directed Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Cortland briskly. "As soon as you have
done so return to me."</p>

<p>Hupner marched off in the darkness with his
dozen men. In a few minutes he was back.</p>

<p>"We'll want until daylight now for the rest
of our work," announced the company commander.</p>

<p>Slowly enough the time passed. No word
was spoken. All was as still around the little
military force as though they had been isolated
in the center of a vast desert.</p>

<p>Then the first faint signs of dawn came.
Some of the soldiers were seated on the ground,
gaping and with difficulty refraining from
going to sleep, for these men of Uncle Sam's
Army had been routed from their beds in the
middle of the night.</p>

<p>The morning light increased, though it was
still dim, and the first vague shapes near the
ledge began to take more definite shape.</p>

<p>"We won't need to wait more than five minutes
more, Sergeant Hupner," declared the captain.</p>

<p>Cortland stood holding his watch close to his
face. As soon as he could read the time he
turned to whisper:</p>

<p>"Now, Overton, lead us up to the exact spot
from which you had your interview with the
fellow Branders."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall the men load, sir?" whispered Sergeant
Hupner.</p>

<p>"Yes; full magazines."</p>

<p>As silently as possible the men of the little
searching party slipped back the bolts of their
pieces and loaded.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Overton," whispered Captain
Cortland.</p>

<p>Just behind Soldier Hal stepped the company
commander himself, watching every footstep
in order not to step on any loose stone that
might sound a premature alarm.</p>

<p>Yet one man among them slipped and made
a noise. It was trifling, but almost instantly
a whistle sounded ahead.</p>

<p>Without even thinking to wait for orders Hal
returned the whistle.</p>

<p>"That you, Tip?" called the voice of an invisible
man. "Good for you, lad. We thought
you was a goner."</p>

<p>Hal did not answer further, for Captain Cortland
broke in:</p>

<p>"Rush 'em, men! We've got 'em."</p>

<p>"Ho! The blazes you have!" sounded a
rough voice ahead. "Come on, boys&mdash;it's the
sojers! Give it to 'em!"</p>

<p>Almost in an instant the crevices between the
rocks ahead were full of red flashes.</p>

<p>Bullets sped, struck rocks with spiteful thuds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and flattened out before bounding into the air
again.</p>

<p>"Lie down, men!" shouted Captain Cortland.
"Give it to the rascals as long as they shoot
at us."</p>

<p>All in a moment this rock-strewn spot had
become a bedlam of discharging firearms.</p>

<p>Two regulars were hit before they could find
cover from which to fire. These men, however,
made no outcry, but, finding themselves unable
to handle their rifles, lay quietly where
they had fallen until the time came for them
to have attention.</p>

<p>Though he had sharply ordered his men to
lie down, Captain Cortland did nothing of the
sort himself. Instead, with his revolver drawn,
he stood up, peering ahead and trying to get
sight of the scoundrels beyond.</p>

<p>Bullets flew all about the captain, many of
them passing his head. But he stood there
calmly until he caught just the opportunity for
which he had waited.</p>

<p>Then his pistol spoke, and a groan beyond
showed that he had been a successful marksman.</p>

<p>"Squad, rise!" shot out the commander's
order. "Charge!"</p>

<p>Crouching low, the soldiers sprang suddenly
forward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Halt! Lie down," continued Cortland. He
had gained sixty feet by his rush without loss
of a man. "Fire only when you see something
to shoot at. Commence firing at will."</p>

<p>Now the firing slackened, though it was not
less deadly. Even the scoundrels ahead slowed
down their fire, as though they found their
weapons becoming hot.</p>

<p>Captain Cortland was in no hurry. He meant
to have the scoundrels, dead or alive, but he
did not intend to risk his own men needlessly.
The army officer knew it was now only a question
of time. Nor did he fear running out of
ammunition, for the greater part of his small
command was not yet in action, but posted beyond.</p>

<p>The daylight grew stronger; then the upper
rim of the sun peeped over the horizon, sending
its rays into the sky.</p>

<p>"Cease firing," commanded Cortland at last.
Then he called over the rocks.</p>

<p>"Are you fellows ready to surrender to
United States forces?"</p>

<p>"Not until we're all dead," came the taunting
reply.</p>

<p>"Then we'll try to accommodate you by killing
you with as little delay as possible," called
back the captain. Then, to his own little force
he added:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Men, advance as you see opportunity. Fire
whenever you see anything to aim at."</p>

<p>Steadily the regulars crawled forward, a foot
or a yard at a time.</p>

<p>As they moved they tried, Indian fashion, to
find new cover behind rocks over which they
could aim and fire.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll, not ten feet apart, occasionally
glanced at each other after firing.</p>

<p>Both young rookies were thoroughly enjoying
this actual taste of fighting life.</p>

<p>It was not many minutes before the advancing
handful of soldiers were within seventy or
eighty feet of the rocks that sheltered the rascals.</p>

<p>Then suddenly they saw three crouching
figures begin to retreat among the rocks.</p>

<p>With a cheer the attacking force went forward,
crouching.</p>

<p>But just then three rifles from out beyond
spoke, and bullets whistled past the scoundrels
from a new quarter.</p>

<p>"Great smoke, boys!" bellowed one of the
fugitives hoarsely. "The sojers have us
hemmed in on all sides."</p>

<p>"Yes, we have," shouted Captain Cortland.
"Do you want to surrender?"</p>

<p>"Make your men stop shooting or moving,
and give us two minutes to think."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll keep on advancing and firing until
we have your surrender," retorted Captain
Cortland grimly. "Whenever you want to surrender
tell me so and raise your hands high
in the air."</p>

<p>"Wait a min&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep on firing, men," called Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>"Hold on! We give in, Cap."</p>

<p>"Cease firing, men," called the commander
of B Company. "Now you fellows jump up
and show yourselves with your hands reaching
for the sky."</p>

<p>Three rough-looking figures clambered up on
rocks, holding their empty hands as high as
they could get them. One of them had his neck
bound, and there was blood on his clothing.
This was the first man whom Hal had wounded
back of Captain Ruggles's quarters at the beginning
of the fray.</p>

<p>"Stand just that way until we reach you,"
ordered the army officer. "Close in on them,
men, and fire if you see one of them reach for
a weapon."</p>

<p>But the trio plainly had no further intentions
in the way of fighting. They waited, sullen-faced
and silent, until the soldiers had
reached them and had taken away their
weapons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have handcuffs, Sergeant?" inquired
the captain.</p>

<p>Hupner and Corporal Cotter both produced
the steel bracelets. The three rogues were
swiftly handcuffed.</p>

<p>"You'll find our boss over yonder," nodded
one of the men. "He's bad hit, too."</p>

<p>They found the fellow, nearly unconscious,
but groaning, his right shoulder badly shattered
by the bullet from Captain Cortland's
revolver.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," directed B Company's commander,
"send a messenger back to the post
for hospital men and an ambulance. You can
report that two of our own men have been hit."</p>

<p>The leader of the scoundrels was lifted and
carried back where the two men of B Company
lay. Captain Cortland directed such aid
as could be given on the spot to all of the
wounded men.</p>

<p>"Shall I call in the men I posted, sir?" inquired
Hupner.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Sergeant. There may be others
of this gang hidden somewhere among the
rocks. But you may take three men and search
for others."</p>

<p>Within ten minutes the search had been made
thoroughly. No more of the evil band had
been found.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll go back just as soon as the ambulance
arrives and the wounded have been taken
care of," announced Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>Hal, at that moment, had his eye on one of
the prisoners. He saw a gleam of satisfaction
show in the fellow's eyes.</p>

<p>"May I speak, sir?" asked Private Overton,
saluting Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the officer.</p>

<p>"May some of us remain behind them, sir,
to search all this ground over?"</p>

<p>"For what, Overton?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem likely, sir, that these scoundrels
have been living in the open air. And
they must have some place for concealing their
booty."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Overton. Corporal Cotter, take
Overton, Terry and two other men and make a
thorough search of the rocks and ground hereabouts."</p>

<p>Hal turned swiftly to the man in whose eyes
he had seen that gleam of satisfaction the moment
before. Now the fellow was scowling.</p>

<p>"That was a hit," Hal murmured to himself.
"The rascals have some hiding place around
here."</p>

<p>"Now we'll divide the ground up in small
squares," announced Corporal Cotter as he led
his picked men away. "We'll search each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
square minutely, so that no little patch may be
overlooked."</p>

<p>"Won't it be best, Corporal," hinted Hal,
"to start where the thieves were when the
fighting began?"</p>

<p>"Just the ticket, Overton," nodded the corporal.</p>

<p>So the search began at that point. Nor did
it last long, for Hal, thrusting with the butt
of his rifle, poked a large bush partly aside
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I guess you'd better come here, Corporal,"
the recruit called.</p>

<p>As Cotter came running to the spot Private
Overton displayed a hole rising some three feet
above the grounds. It had been covered by the
foliage of the bush.</p>

<p>"Looks like the mouth of a cave, doesn't
it?" Hal asked, with gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>"A whole lot," agreed Corporal Cotter, producing
a pocket electric flashlight. "You can
follow me in, Overton, if you like."</p>

<p>Corporal and private crawled into the hole.
They did not have to go more than six feet
before they stood in a stone-walled chamber
of considerable size. Roughly, it appeared to
be an apartment of about twenty by thirty-five
feet.</p>

<p>"Beds, tables, chairs, lamps, grub," enumerated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Corporal Cotter, looking about him
gleefully. "Take the lamp, Overton. I'm
going back to call the captain."</p>

<p>Less than two minutes later Captain Cortland
stood in the rockbound chamber.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a place!" whistled the officer
in surprise.</p>

<p>"This chest is locked, sir," reported Hal,
who had been improving his time by looking
about. "Do you think it may contain loot.
Captain?"</p>

<p>"There's an ax," nodded Cortland, glancing
around him. "Corporal, just try the ax on the
chest&mdash;carefully."</p>

<p>With a few blows Cotter had the chest open.
Captain Cortland knelt by the wooden chest
to inspect.</p>

<p>"This is clothing on top," he announced.
"But&mdash;ah, what does this look like?"</p>

<p>In the middle of the chest's contents he had
come upon carefully wrapped packages of
jewelry, watches and the like.</p>

<p>"We won't go any further just now," declared
the captain. "But we'll take back this
chest with us."</p>

<p>On the return to Fort Clowdry the prisoners,
though captured on the military reservation,
were turned over to the civil officers. Even
Tip Branders and the wounded chief of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
band were taken to Clowdry for care by the
town authorities.</p>

<p>The chest was found to have contained all
the stolen jewelry. The money that had been
taken on the same raids, however, was not
found. Plainly the thieves had used the money
for the needs of the moment.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll, on their return, reported
promptly to the commander of the guard, for
they still belonged to the guard detail.</p>

<p>"Queer, ain't it?" asked Private Bill Hooper
that morning in Hupner's squad room as the
men were washing up before morning mess
call.</p>

<p>"What is?" demanded Private Hyman.</p>

<p>"Why, that kid, Overton, knew one of the
gang&mdash;one, at least&mdash;all the time. Yet Overton
shot his old-time friend. And Overton
knew all along where the bunch was hiding.
And did you hear how neatly he led Corporal
Cotter right to the cave of the gang? Now if
that don't prove&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hyman promptly knocked Hooper down.</p>

<p>"It proves, Bill," growled Hyman, "that
you're so fond of lying that you don't know
the truth when you hear it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>


<div class='cap'>TIP BRANDERS recovered.</div>

<p>So did the leader of the gang with
which Tip had foolishly cast his evil
lot down in Pueblo, when he had first come
west after robbing his mother. The man
wounded in the neck had been at no time in a
dangerous condition.</p>

<p>Not much sympathy need be wasted on Tip.
He had chosen his own place in life, and had
filled it.</p>

<p>Before Tip was out of the local hospital, and
in his cell in jail, his mother, who had read
of his fate in a newspaper in her home town,
joined her son in the town of Clowdry.</p>

<p>She stood by her son to the last, until the
testimony of officers and soldiers from Fort
Clowdry had sent him away to prison for ten
years.</p>

<p>At first, on his recovery, Tip Branders had
been inclined to be boastful. He had shown
his boldness by his thieving exploits and by
daring to face the steady rifle fire of Private
Hal Overton, United States Army. But when
the sentence of the court came upon him Tip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
broke down. He wept and could hardly stand.
He implored the judge to lessen his sentence.
All the braggadocio in him ran out as rapidly
as the sawdust from a punctured doll.</p>

<p>The other members of the band received
equally severe sentences, for all had been engaged
in battle with troops who represent law
and order.</p>

<p>From that trial Hal and Noll journeyed to
Denver. Major Davis, of the Seventeenth Cavalry,
also traveled from his post, for the trial
of the baffled men who had attempted to rob
the United States mail was on in the United
States District Court. These men, too, were
sent away to the penitentiary for long terms.</p>

<p>The writer of the anonymous note against
Hal had so far escaped detection.</p>

<p>"We've been getting a lot of travel lately,"
smiled Hal as the two chums trudged down the
road from the railway station to Fort Clowdry
on their return from Denver.</p>

<p>"All we're going to have for a while, I
hope," returned Noll Terry quietly. "I'd
sooner put in my time learning soldiering."</p>

<p>"Not tired of the army yet, Noll?"</p>

<p>"I never shall be, nor you either, Hal, as
long as we're young enough to serve."</p>

<p>"What I dread," mused Hal, "is the time
when if we live to that age, we shall be too old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
for the Army, and will have to go away and settle
down in some town as retired men of the
Army."</p>

<p>"That will be time to die, won't it?" asked
Noll, so solemnly that Private Overton laughed
merrily.</p>

<p>"That time is a long way off, Noll Terry.
Let's see; we're eighteen now, and a fellow
doesn't have to be retired, for age, until he's
sixty-two."</p>

<p>"Forty-four years," figured Noll. "Oh,
well, a fellow ought to be able to have a deal of
fun in that number of years."</p>

<p>Both recruits were in merry mood as they
turned in past the sentry at the main entrance
to the post grounds.</p>

<p>They kept on, full of life and spirits until they
reached the edge of the parade ground.</p>

<p>"Attention!" murmured Hal quietly.</p>

<p>Unostentatiously but with a world of reverence
in their act both young soldiers lifted their
uniform caps close to the shadow of the grand
old Flag.</p>

<p>Without halting they passed on, returning
their caps to their heads. Both young men of
the service walked a trifle more erectly, if that
were possible.</p>

<p>Nor had they gone much further when they
espied a man coming toward them. The broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
white stripes down the seam of his trousers,
and the double-barred shoulder straps proclaimed
the infantry officer. It was Captain
Cortland, commanding officer of B Company.</p>

<p>Both young soldiers raised their right hands
smartly in salute as they passed the officer, who
returned their salute in kind. Then Cortland
halted.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you back, Overton."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"And you, too, Terry."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"And, by the way, Terry, I have remembered
your request that you be transferred to B Company,
and to Sergeant Hupner's squad room.
Captain Freeman said he was sorry to lose you,
Terry; but since you wanted to be with your
friend, he has consented to your transfer to B
Company. The matter has been arranged
through the adjutant, and my first sergeant will
notify you of your transfer when you return to
your former squad room. I'm very glad,
Terry, to have so good a soldier as yourself in
B Company, even if I do have to rob Captain
Freeman."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied Noll, with another
salute.</p>

<p>Then the two young soldiers resumed their
walk. Just as soon as they were out of earshot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of Captain Cortland, Noll broke forth jubilantly:</p>

<p>"In the same company at last, Hal, old fellow.
Oh, won't it be great, now that we're
truly bunkies at last!"</p>

<p>Great indeed&mdash;greater than either Hal Overton
or Noll Terry guessed. They stood at the
beginning, though neither suspected it, of some
exciting and never-to-be-forgotten incidents and
phases of the soldier's life.</p>

<p>What followed, however, will have to be reserved
for the next volume in this series, which
will be published under the title: "<span class="smcap">Uncle Sam's
Boys on Field Duty</span>; Or, Winning Corporal's
Chevrons." In this volume the two young soldiers
will be found to be no longer recruits, but
trained soldiers of the Regular Army, and in
the midst of a series of rousing adventures incidental
to the military life.</p>
